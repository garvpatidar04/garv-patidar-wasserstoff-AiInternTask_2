the company shall have paramount lien on and deduct and set off moiety thereof against any payment which the said mills may make in respect of the decrees or any of them andor costs of the said suits. therefore this case is covered by the judgment of the court of appeal in mitchell case ...... applying this line of reasoning the high court differed from the conclusion of the tribunal and allowed the deduction to the respondent company under section 02 xv of the incometax act, as claimed by the respondents. nowhere in the statement of the case prepared by the tribunal and filed in the high court, the tribunal had come to the conclusion that the payment was made by the assessee company to avoid any danger of public exposure or to save itself from scandal or in order to maintain the managing agency of the appellant company. when the matter came before the high court, mr. mitra, who argued the case for the present respondents, as shown by the judgment of the high court, urged as follows if the applicant company had not agreed to pay the amount mentioned i l 92 . . hereas the nath bank limited demanded from the mills the payment of the sum of rs. ,80,000 and interest there on

the tribunal in the present case, the process was reversed and the procedure adopted was to take mit chell case as the law and argue that the facts in the present case covered the situation. it is therefore clear that the necessary facts required to be established before the principles laid down in mitchell case2 could be applied, have not been found as facts in the present case at any stage of the proceedings and the high court was in error il 6 i... h9. the rules franed under the incometax ltd. act is prepared with the knowledge of the parties concerned and they have full opportunity to

discussion started with quotation from the case stated by the commissioners as the facts of the case. supreme court reports 05 necessary facts in that connection was on the assessee, 950 it being

was entitled to exemption under section 02 xv of the incometax act on the ground that the payment was an expenditure which was not in the nature of capital expenditure or personal expenses of the applicant company but was an expenditure laid out wholly and exclusively for the purpose of its busi ness. in the statement of the case submitted by the tribunal after reciting the fact of the incorporation of the company and the terms of the compromise mention ed above, the arguments urged on behalf of the assessee company have been recapitulated. lt appears that certain hundis were drawn by one of the directors of the respondent company, acting in the capacity of the managing agents of the mill company, in the name of the mill company and the same were negotiated to others. this statement of the case prepared by the income tax tribunal and submitted to the high court for its opinion was perused by the parties and they had no suggestions to make in respect of the same. one of the directors of the assessee company, acting in the capacity of managing agents of certain fills, had dravn some hundis in the name of tho mills, aod as the mills repudiated lia bility, suits were filed on the hundis against the mills and the assessees. the books of account of basanti cotton mills ltd. would show that they were paying the applicant company in full its remuneration and the books

sued the company for the reali oommi of sation of the amounts due on the hundis and it seems incomtax, that there would have been no defence to the action. the high court fell into grave error in omitting first to ascer tain what were the facts found in the case stated by the tribunal. held, that the high court acted wrongly in accepting the argurrents of the assessees counsel as if they were

objective, or if the impugned act, though it was not originally conceived at the time when the earlier act was passed, was only an extension or further step by legislature for implementing the object of the earlier act or if the legislature by express reference incorporated in the impugned act the provisions of the earlier act, it would be permissible to rely upon the said provisions of the earlier act, not because they formed part of the prevailing conditions but because either the earlier act formed part of the impugned act by reference or both of them formed part of the same legislative plan. the process of recoupment was thus stated in paragraph 4 of the said main affidavit of shri jain the incidence of loss on the first quota of 50,000 tons fixed by the government was

should have regard to the quantity of sugar available in india, the quantity of sugar which, in its opinion, would be reasonably required for consumption in india, and the necessity for exporting sugar with view to earning foreign excliange in the public interest. being the amount calculated at the rate of rs. 3569 np. per maund in respect of the total sugar quota, less excise duty to be paid

price fixed for sugar.cane, manufacturing cost, taxes, the lord krihna reasonable margin of profit for producer andor trade, sugar mills ltd., and any incidental charges. 8 the export agency shall take all practical measures to export sugar delivered to it under this act provided that, if the export agency is of opinion that having regard to the quality of the sugar deliver ed to it by any owner, or to the expenses involved in transporting. in fixing such quantity the central government shall have regard to the quantity of sugar available in india, the the quantity of sugar which, in its opinion, would be reasonably required for consumption in india, the necessity for exporting sugar with view to earning foreign exchange in the public interest. iection 6 enjoins on the owners of sugar factories to deliver to the export agency, appointed under the act, the sugar produced in their factories in such quiintities, of such grade, in such manner, within such time and iit such place, as may be specified hy the export agency in that behalf. besides, there was nothing in the essential commodities act or the sugar control order which authorised the govern ment to increase the price for the sake of recouping to the manufacturers the loss caused to them by the impugned act, and the validity of the notification increasing the home price of sugar was doubtful. section 6 then provides that on demand by the export agency, every owner shall deliver to it from time to time, sugar procluced in his factory in such quantities not exceeding in the aggregate his export quota fixed for the factory or group of factories, as the case may be, of such grade, in such manner, within such time and at such place, as may be specified by the export agency in this behalf. the question then is, is the increase in the home price of sugar made by the government by notification issued under the powers given to it by another act which has the effect of wiping out the loss inflicted by the impugned act, circumstance which makes the restrictions imposed by the latter act reasonable? the quota delivered, or in case the owner is allowed to sell the sugar himself, the sugar purchased from the saleproceeds, is exported, and the nett saleproceeds are distributed among the owners in proportion to the quantity of sugar delivered by them for export. it is said that the central government in fixing the price for sugar produced during the season 95758, in vacuum pan sugar factories situate in the areas speci fied in the order had taken into account the possible loss the exporters might incur by reason of the applica tion of the provisions of the impugned act. 7 where sugar delivered by any owner falls short of the export quota fixed for it by any quantity hereinafter referred to as the said quantity, there shall be levied and collected on so much of the sugar despatched from the factory for consumption in india as is equal to the said quantity, duty of excise at the rate of seventeen rupees per maund. section 6 provides that every owner of factory shall, on demand by the export agency deliver to it sugar upto its export quota and on delivery the owner shall retain no rights in respect of such sugar except his right to receive payment therefor under section 9. in the yaar 9552 the 76 supreme court reports 960 959 sugar manufacturers were placed in difficult position the lo krishna because of competition from khandsari and gur sugar mills lid.. manufacturers, who could buy sugar cane for their and another manufactures at low price in the open market, while . exported during any period taking into consideration the quantity of sugar available in the country the quantity of sugar recuired for consump tion in the country and the necessity of exporting sugar with view to earning foreign exchange in the public interest, but, so as not to exceed 20 per cent. the object and purpose of the act is to export sugar and to divide the receipts less expenses, among the owners who supply sugar for export. the object is to provide for the export of sugar in the interest of public and that object is sought to be achieved by fixing the quota of sugar for export and distributing the same among the owners of factories subject to the condition that in no case it should exceed twenty per cent. supreme court reports 79 i therefore come to the conclusion that the act i 959 which makes the petitioners suffer loss on the sale the lord krishna of part of their produce imposes restriction on sugar mills ltd., their right to carry on their business which cannot in and another the circumstances of this case he said to be reasonable . jain, chief director, directorate of sugar, affirmed on february 3, 959 and filed on behalf of the government, to show that the act contemplated that the export of sugar made under it would result in loss. mills mformed the export agency their mabhty sugar mills ltd., to sell sugar at the controlled rate fixed by the govern and another ment by its notification of july 30, 958, as the market . the peti tioners analyse the scheme of the act, and state that it amounts to taking sugar from owners for sale abroad at such price as it may fetch, the owners being paid when such money is received, after deducting the expenses of the export agency and the cost of export. 5 the petitioners challenged the constitutionality of the sugar export promotion act, 958, which was enacted for the purpose of exporting sugar with view to earning foreign exchange. section 8 empowers the export agency, after taking delivery, to export the sugar or permit the owner to sell the whole or any part of the export quota in his custody at price approved by it on condition that the saleproceeds are payable to it. in reply, the learned attorneygeneral on behalf of the union as well as the directorate of sugar refers to the negotiations which took place between the government and the sugar industry and the arrange ments which were made to save owners of factories from the loss which is inevitable as result of this export programme. it is stated that the 62 supreme court reports 960 z959 section deals with sugar delivered to the export agency, tlordkrishna and.here.there as no sugar delivered. subbn rao, supp reasona racton sugar pro uce their factories, the export agency would not get the requisite quantity of sugar for export. the exchange value that sugar manufacturer is entitled to get under the act for sugar delivered by him, therefore, depends entirely on the export agency. it appears that .le export agency felt that the petitioners were neither going to sell the sugar and pay the sale proceeds nor to deliver the sugar and it there upon pointed out to the petitioners that they were hy their conduct exposing themrelves to the risk of having to pay the additional excise duty under . i find nothing in the essential commodities act nor naturally in the sugar control order, 955, which would authorise the government to increase the price simply for the sake of recouping to the manu facturers the loss caused to them by the impugned act. it appears however that various representatives of the government and the sugar manufacturers met and decided upon the idea of export ing sugar for earning foreign exchange in government inkrest and getting foothold in the world market in the intrests of the manufacfurers. r4 of the constitution in select ing sugar produced by the vacuum pan process for export and in leaving out sugar produced by other methods and other commodities from the mischief of the act. the export agency hidayatullah . reminded the ... mills that the industry had agreed to finance the export agency division by letting it have the saleproceeds of sugar diverted for internal sale less rs. 0 per maund as an on account pay ment. in testing the reasonableness of the sugar mills ltd., restrictions imposed by the impugned act it was not permissible and another to take into consideration the notification under the sugar . the object of the act was, therefore, demorrntrably to serve the national interest and the scheme evolved certainly had relation to the object sought to he achieved, for all the pro visions of the act were conceived in glmuine attempt to induce foreign export in sugar by cooperative effort. the export agency shall, at such time as it thinks fit, make to the owners who have 9 66 supreme court reports 960 959 delivered sugar to it under this act, payments deter dk. mined in accordance with the provisions hereinafter in , or ris ha th . . agency in respect of the sugar, whether by way of administrative expenses or otherwise, and the balance shall be apportioned among the owners in proportion to the quantity nf sugn. deliered by them respectively during tlmt ye. 3 in making any distribution under this section, the export igency shall make such adjustments as may he necessary having rc,gard to the grade of sugar ! section 7 makes provision for an additional excise duty being levied in certain circum stances on the quantity of sugar by which the sugar delivered by the owner of factory falls short of its export quota. 60 supreme court reports 960 r959 indeed, an examination of the correspondence in the first case clearly demonstrates that the mills were the lord rislina devising one excuse or another to void the liability sugar iifills ltd., andanother to supply the quota of sugar. the export agency also sent an order for delivery of the quota sugar, and required the ... mills to depatch it by goods train, freight to pay, consigned to the export agency. it is also pointed out that government at that time did not wish to take over the work of export on itself and specified as the export agency, the indian sugar mills association, body composed of 95 per cent. the ... mills, how ever, did not agree to this, and the export agency thereafter on december 8, 958, sent telegram that unless the drafts were retired immediately, the quota sugar should be kept ready for despatch so that delivery might be taken by the export agency. it was under this order that the government issued notification on july 30, 958, enhancing the home price of sugar by 50 np. per maund which it is said wipes out the loss caused by the impugned act. but i am clear in my mind thatthe validity of an act shall not be made to depend upon another act unconnected with the impugned act or power conferred thereunder, which .might, if properly exercised, off.set the evil tendency or the vice of the impugned act. of the mills have stood by this arrangement, and did either supply their quota of sugar or sold it in the internal market and made available the money for purchase of sugar for export. the lord krishna it cannot but be accepted that the government sugar mills ltd., made adequate arrangements to recoup the sugar and another industry for the loss which it might suffer in giving .. . it is then said that the loss caused by the act was recouped by an order made by the government in creasing the home price of the sugar and therefore in fact the manufacturers suffered no loss. follows the export agency shn., at such time as it thinks fit, make to the owners who ha.ve delivered sugar to it urnler this act, payments dc,tc.rmined in accordance with the provisions hereinafter in this section contained. it was anticipated that the loss would be recouped sugar mills ltd., if there was an increase of 50 np. per maund in and another the price of sugar for internal consumption and the . it was argued by hidayatillah mr. pritt, .., before the privy council that the later act could not be read to justify the earlier act, because if the impugned citizenship act were bad when it was passed, it could not be brought back to light by the enactment of the subsequent act. they were also informed that the central board of evenue had issued detailed instructions to the collec tors of central excise, and that it had been agreed that the order of the chief director sugar served on the owners with copy to the central excise officer of the fo,ctory concerned would also be the release order from the sugar directorate. they contend that if foreign exchange is so urgently needed, there should have been uniform legislation compelling other sugar manufacturers, who do not manufacture by the vacuum pan process, also to export sugar. jain, chief director in the directorate of sugar vanaspati, ministry of food and agriculture depart ment of food, in his affidavit says that the exfactory price of sugar per maund fixed by the said order was made up of the following items average cost of production including margin of profit. 64 supreme court reports 960 r959 the respondent indian sugar mills association was the lord kdsh specified as the export agency under this section. if it is said that the notifica tion was issued for the purposes mentioned in the essential commodities act, it becomes at once apparent, that the price fixed under it has no relation to the impugned act and may have to be altered irrespective of the latter act. the substance of the matter then is that an owner of sugar factory gets in exchange for the sugar deli vered by him under the act, proportionate share of the saleproceeds less the pxpenses. few days before the said order was issued i.., on .june 27, 958, the central govern ment promulgated an ordinance called the sugar export promotion ordinance, and it was subsequently converted into an act , which received the assent of the president on september 6, 958. the effect of the ... supreme court reports 8 said order is that the possible loss to the sugar export z959 ers is offset by the fact that they can recoup

for different grades of sugar which the central government may, by notification in the ojficial gazette, publish in this bchalf. the restrictions imposed by the impugned act were not unreasonable as the j_ct served the national interest by earning foreign exchange for the state and building up foreign markets for the future prosperity of the sugar industry. sugar mill., ltd., section 4 authorises the central government to fix the and anotha quantity of sugar that may be exported during any . . . the notification of the central government increasing the price of sugar to enable the recoupment of the loss occasioned by the export could be taken into consideration in judging the reasonableness of the restrictions. to put it in other words, though the impugned aet docs not confer any power or imposn duty on the uoveriiment to offset tlteloss by fixing the rates of sugar, having regn,rd to the expected losr, the mere fact that it could fix the rn.tes mhkr home other act would make the act good though otherwi bad. it is said that the act was passed with view to earn foreign exchange by export of sugar. for every one maund of sugar exported, the factories have for sale in the internal market 20 maunds of sugar, and on this, on account of the price fixed, they would realise 050 np. they therefore, expressed their inability to send any sugar they also stated that if they redeemed the pledged sugar even after paying the on account money to the bank, 52 supreme court reports 960 z959 the bank would be receiving rs. central government the quota of sugar allocated to them ii it sugar mills ltd . they raise the question whether the sugar export promotion act, 958 is invalid as imposing an unreasonable restriction on the petitioners right to carry on their trade. in the years 95253 to 95556 india imported large quantities of sugar and did not export sugar at all. of sugar would completely wipe out the loss incurred the union vf in.i on the export under the act of 2 per cent.. of thl and anothu produce of factory. 9 of the act which fixes the amount which manufacturer of sugar in entitled to receive in respect of the sugar delivered by him. in the objects reasons of the act it is stated, with view to earning foreign exchange it is necessary to promote export of sugar. but for the act, the petitioners could have kold their sugar in the open market without exceeding the rnkk fix., under the essential commodities act, !.!i5. though in deciding the reasonablene of the restrictions imposed by the impugned act all the prevailing conditions and circumstances had to be considered, the notification increasing the home price of sugar could not be taken into consideration. the apportionment of the quantity of sugar to be exported is to be in proportion to the quantity of sugar produced or likely to be produced by the owners during the season referred to earlier. so what the trade had agreed to was that they would be prepared to export sugar provided they were left free to recoup from the internal sales the loss caused by the export. out of the total ... supreme court reports 89 saleproceeds, the total expenditure incurred by the z959 export agency in respect of the sugar exported should ld the lord krisllna ucte an tie ance section 8 deals with export of sugar or its sale by the owner or the export agency. 9 and 92 of the british north america act, 867, the legislative assembly of the province of alberta passed an act respecting the taxation of banks and imposed thereunder on every corporation or joint stock company other than the bank of canada, incorporated for the purpose of doing banking or savings bank business in the province, an annual tax, in addition to any tax payable under any other act. it may so ue sugar lfilts ltd., necessary to look into another act to ascertain the etnd another pith and imbstance of an impugned act. that the central government has selected the sugar industry for an export programme does not mean that it cannot make classification of the commodities, bearing in mind which commodity will have an easy market abroad for the purpose of earning foreign exchange. the restriction was not unreasonable, because arrangement was made to save the owners of the factories from loss, and the loss entailed by the export of sugar was to be borne by the consumers in india and not by the producers. the learned attorneygeneral also contends that the petitioners had obtained favourable prices for sale of sugar in the country but were not willing to honour their other commitments which, after the agreement of the sugar industry, were given legislative form. in the act depends on the pooling of the losses on and another export by all sugar factories in india, in proportion to . section 8 then deals with the

india, and with the saleproceeds other sugar was bought and exported, and this would not be possible if the export agency were required to make spot cash payment. section 9 directs the export agency to make payments to the owners, who had delivered sugar to it, in the manner prescribed by the section. in exercise of that power, the central government should not fix the quantity of sugar for export as to exceed in any year in the aggregate twenty per cent. we heard consi derable argument as to whether the section would apply to case where no delivery was at all made, in view of the words where sugar delivered by any owner falls short of the export quota. as the said quantity, there shall be levied and collected on so much of the sugar despatched from the factory for consumption in

directed against the union of india and the indian sugar .ills association export agency division calcutta. for this reason also, sugar produced by the vacuum pan process may have been selected, because such sugar is perhaps in demand abroad and not.sugar produced by any other process. they further state that if the necessity for foreign exchange was felt, the loss entailed in the earning of foreign exchange should be borne by government or be distri buted among all industries, or at least among all the sugar producers in the country. the foreign export served the national interest by stabilising the sugar market and stabilised national economy by earning foreign exchange. the essential commodities act, 955 act , was enacted for the purpose mentioned in the preamble to that act. sec tion 3 empowers the central government to specify company or other body corporate as the export agency to perform the functions of that agency under the act. i proceed now to consider .he respondents rea.son for saying that the act imposes 0 loss on the sugar manufacturers including the petitioners. saying that the act would stabilise the sugar industry, the union of india the affidavits used on behalf of the respondents do not and .nohu show how that would be done or that there was any sarkar. the argument over6oks the scheme that export is made by central agency for the industry as whole, and the prices obtained abroad are payable, and they are less than those at which sugar of various grades sells within the country. it is said that this is so that in judging the reason ableness of the restriction imposed by one act, it is permissible to consider an order made by the executive government under another act. the impugned act caused loss to the petitioners which was not negligible and thus imposed unreasonable restrictions on 6 42 supreme court reports 960 959 their right to carry on their business. the export agency offered to show concession to the ...

by it. section 0 confers power on the central government to give directions to the export agency in discharge of its functions under the act. the ... miils, however, insisted that they were unable to

staqilising the sugar market so that the production of sugarcane niay be maintained at rea,onable level. the argument then is that though the impugned act produces loss, that loss can he ignored

such other purposes as the government may consider desirable. the petitioners and another hidayatullah . contend that the whole export programme in respect of sugar amounts to an infringement of their fund amental rights under arts. they state that the owners stand to lose, because, admittedly, sugar is going to be exported at loss, and the loss is to fall on the owners of factories. there shall be

categories i an earlier act is made part of new act and ii both acts are parts of legislative scheme or plan where both of them were conceived at the inception but passed in stages, or conceived at different times on the basis of experience gained but passed in furtherance of the same scheme. section 5 of the act enables the central govemment the union of india to apportion, by order in writing, the quantity to be and another exported among owners of factories, the word hidayatullah . since the export was by nonprofitmaking agency composed of the sugar industry, it is obvious that the payments could not be made forthwith. section 9 deals with payments to owners who have delivered sugar for export. it was realised that the export would result in loss but the manu facturers agreed to export provided they were allowed to make up the loss from the internal market. and were not unreasonable as arrangements vere made to save them frotn joss by increasing the price of sugar for internal sales, thus passing on the loss to the consumers in india. we are unable to accept th plea that the petitioners were not able to sell sugar at the controlled price, because the price was fixed too high. it is true that the association had suggested that the government should take steps for export of sugar. for the levy and collection, in certain circumstances, the union of india of an additional duty of excise on sugar produced in and another india. the petitioners further contend that manufacturers of commodities other than sugar are not compelled to export in like manner, and thus there is further discrimination. 7. it was then that the present applicationr for appropriate writs restraining the respondents from taking steps under the act were launched by the petitioners on the ground inter alia that the act was invalid as it unrearonably restricted the petitionerr right to carry on their trade. it would thus appear that the sugar industry in india has always been stable and did not require any export to make it stable. the condition that the saleproceeds are payable to the export agency is perfectly valid, regard being had to the scheme of the export and the advantage allowed on all sales in india. of sugar abroad be made and it was for that reason that the impugned act was passed. 5, the central government is empowered to apportion the quantity of sugar fixed from time to time for. that reason involves principle of farreaching importance, namely, whether, in ascertaining the reasonableness of restrictions imposed by statute on fundamental right, it is permissible to rely upon notification issued by government in exercise of power conferred on it by another act unconnected with the impugned one. if this argument be accepted correct., even if the notifioation was not issued, the existence of such power under some other act would be enough to validate the impugned act, for, thongh the notifimt tion was not issued, it may be issued at . the the

circumstances such as the agree ments, price adjustments and price control, as they have no bearing upon the resonableness of the legis lation. the loss which the restrictions imposed by the act on the petitioners trade caused to them, was by no means such as could only have been avoided by incurring greater loss. indeed on the respon dents own affidavits it is not open to them to say that they hope that it may be possible in future to make profit oil export of sugar. the impugned act and the essential commodities act were enacted for different purposes. to prevent any loss to the petitioners, countervailing additional prices were allowed on sales of sugar for internal consumption. 88 supreme court reports 960 959 let me now consider the reasonableness of the restrictions

  "summary": "it is true that the high court has taken different view to that taken by the trying magistrate and has rejected the appellant case that he had vol untarily handed over the currency notes in question to the customs officers in the circumstances mentioned by him and that he had no intention to take that money out of india without permit. it found, on the evidence of the superintendent of the reserve bank, that the reserve bank received no application from the appellant before september 7, 952, nor had the reserve bank granted the permission to the appellant to take any currency notes out of india. the additional district magistrate thereon recorded the following order seen the complaint filed to day against the accused narayandas bhagwandas madhavdas under section 82 of the foreign exchange regulation act read with section 23b thereof read with section 9 of the sea customs act and notification no. .... in the present case cognizance was taken vhen on february 2, 953, the additional district magistrate applied his mind to the case vith vie to issuing process and sent the case for trial to another magistrate. the main submission on behalf of the appellant was directed towards establishing that the entire proceed ings before the additional district magistrate and the trying magistrate were without jurisdiction as cogniz ance of the offence had been taken on september 6, 952, in contravention of the provisions of . this was also allowed and warrant of arrest was issued by the additional district magistrate and appellant was thereafter irrested and

reason that the additional district magistrate had either on september 6, or at any sub sequent date upto february 2, 953, applied his mind to the case with view to issuing process against the appellant. it is clear from these orders that on september 9, 952, the additional district magistrate had not taken cognizance of the offence because he had allowed the police time till november 9, 952, for completing the investigation. magi strate to issue warrant of arrest and his order directing the issue of such warrant cannot also be regarded as orders which indidate that the additional district magistrate thereby took cognizance of the offence. inspector mitra was so authorized by the reserve bank tm september , 952, and in pursuance of that authorization applied to the additional district magistrate for the issue of search warrant. the second point urged on hchalf of the applllant was that on 8eptember 6, 952, when the ... supreme court reports 95 magistrate issued the warrant of arrest against the appellant he could not have done so without having previously taken congnizance of the offence. there was no legal bar to the additional district magistrate taking cogniz ance of the offence on february 2, 953, as on that date inspector mitra complaint was one which he was authorized to make by the reserve bank under . on that date the complaint was filed and the order of the additional district magistrate clearly indicated that he took cognizance of the offence and sent the case for trial to mr. sinha. supreme court reports 99 connection on september 5 and 6, 952, inspector mitra of the special police establishment, calcutta had applied for search warrant and warrant iif ar rest respectively against the appellant. it seems to me clear however that before it can be said that any magistrate has taken cognizance of any offence under section 90 criminal procedure code, he must not only have applied his mind to the contents of the petition but murt have done so for the purpose of proceeding in particular way as indicated in the subsequent provi sions of this chapterproceeding under section 200 and thereafter sending it for inquiry and report under section 202. if, on the other hand, after completing the investig ation complaint was filed, as in this case, it would be the duty of the additional district magistrate then to enquire whether the complaint had been filed with the requisite authority of the reserve bank as required by . in order to facilitate his investigation it was necessary for him to arrest the appellant and that he could not do without warrant of arrest from the additional district magistrate. the complaint was filed on february 2, 953, before the additional district magistrate who transferred the case to magistrate i class for trial. 23 of the foreign exchange regulation act and the additional district magistrate could take cognizance of the offence which, indeed, he did on that date. in our opinion, the proceedings before the additional district magistrate and the trying magistrate were with jurisdiction and the trial of the appellant was legal. mitra thereupon applied to the additional district, magistrate on september 6, 952, for search warrant i959 narayandas bhagwandas jy!adltavda . it was also urged that explana tion offered by the appellant was accepted by the trying magistrate and the high court ought not to have set aside the acquittal of the appellant, there being no good ground why his explanation should not have been accepted. on september 9, the magistrate granted bail to the appellant but refused him exemption from personal attendance before the court and granted time till november 9, 952, for completing the investigation. on september 9, 952, the appellant appeared before the additional district magistrate who recorded the following order he is to give bail of rs. the orders passed by the additional district magistrate on september 6, 952, setember 9, 952, november 9, 952, and january 2, 953, were orders passed while the investigation by the police into noncognizable offence was in progress. 69 of the code released him on his executing bond with or without sureties to appear if and when so required before the additional district magistrate empowered to take cognizance of the offence on police report and to try the accused or commit him for trial. it is clear, therefore, that upto september 6, 952, the additional district magistrate had not taken cognizance of any offence. the order of the additional district magistrate directing the issue of search warrant and the word permitted contained ,herein we consider, in the context of the application, to mean that he granted the sanction for investigation as asked for. 98 supreme court reports 960 fiinding on question of fact to what the trying magi strate had found, it was open to the appellant to urge that he was entitled to question the findings of the high court. the additional district magistrate, however, must be regarded as having taken cognizance on this date because he sent the case to mr. sinha for trial. an important circumstance which might have supported the appellant case, namely whether he had applied to the reserve bank of india for per mit to take out of india currency notes to the extent of rs. the offence was taken by the additional district magistrate on february 2, 953, after the complaint had been filed and the trial was valid. 93 of the foreign exchange regulation act district magistrate or magistrate of the first class may, on representation in writing .ade it was, however, argued that when mitra applied for search warrant on septem ber, 6, 952, the additional district magistrate had recorded an order thereon, permitted. 233 of the foreign exchange regulation act vii of 947 was not obtained till january 27, 953, the cognizance taken by the magistrate on september 6, 952, was without jurisdiction. on september ii, 952, the reserve bank authorised inspector mitra to move the additional district magistrate, 24 parganas under . the agpellant contended that the entire trial was without jurisdiction as the magistrate had taken cognizance of the offence on september 6, 952, without there being complaint in writing by person autho rised as required by . 552 of the code of criminal procedure, no police officer shall investigate noncognizable offence without the order of magi strate of the first or second class having power to try such case or commit the same for trial, or of presid ency magistrate. 9 of the sea cus toms act  as it could not be said that at the moment the appellant was searched by the customs officials, he was taking out of india across any customs frontier as defined by the central government the cur rency notes in question. of search warrant and warrant of arrst, if amount to taking cogniz anceattempting to tahe rnrrency notes out of indiaforeign exchange regulation act, r947 vii of r947, ss. r93 and 233. code of criminal, procedure, r898 of r898, ss. it does seem extraordinary that if the appellant had sent the application to joshi on september 2, 952, that joshi should not have sent on that application to the reserve bank till september 5, 952. on september 6, 952, mitra applied to the magistrate for search warrant and for warrant of arrest and both warrants were issued. the high court gave very good reasons for accepting the evidence of the prosecution witnesses as to the circumstiinces in which the currency notes in question were recovered from the appellant when his person was searched. issuing of search warrant for the purpose of an investigation or of warrant of arrest for that purpose cannot by themselves be regarded as acts by which cognizance was taken of an offence. in other words, the appellant version, in substance, was that as he had failed to get the permit upto the last moment he vol untarily handed over the currency notes in question to the customs officers at the customs barrier for safe keeping. the high court thought that the contention of the appellant raised question of law and granted the requisite certificate for appeal to this court. 233 of the foreign exchange regulation act, there being on that date no complaint in writing made by an officer authorised in that behalf by the central government or the reserve bank of india by general or special order. as already stated, the order of the additional district magistrate of september 9, 952, makes it quite clear that he was still regarding the matter as one under investigation. upon conclusion of the triai the magistrate acquitted the appellant but on appeal the calcutta high court convicted him. it was on this date that the additional district magistrate took cognizance of the offence. it was necessary therefore for inspector mitra to obtain from the additional district magistrate warrant of arrest. the main submission made on hehalf of the appellant before s has been that the additional istric magistrate jrnving taken congnizance of the offonee on cpt.em her hl, 952, and as the provisions of . according to the appellant, he had applied to the reserve bank of india at calcutta for permit and had sent an pplica tion for that purpose to one joshi in calcutta. that is to say, that the additional district magistrate was not being asked to take cognizance of the offence. it is true that the appellant had not taken the currency notes in question out of india across any customs frontier as defined by the.central government. it was on september 6, that the reserve bank had received an application of the appellant forwarded by one .. ,joshi by his letter dated september 5, 952."

  "summary": "the dispute arose regarding the payment of bonus in 953 the workmen claimed that the sole object of bonus which had been grantecf to them upto that year was to meet puja expenses and that the payment of this bonus had become customary and term of employment. held, that the workmen were not entitled to puja bonus as an implied term of employment for an implied agreement could not be inferred when the appellant had made it clear that the payments from 948 to 952 were ex gratia but they were entitled to puja bonus on the basis that it was customary and traditional payment. in determining whether the payment was customary and traditional the following circumstances have to be established i that the payment has been made over an unbroken series of years , ii that it has been for sufficiently long period, the period has to be longer than in the case of an implied term of employment iii that it has been paid even in years of loss and did not depend on the earning of profits and iv that the payment has been made at uniform rate throughout. the decision of the appellate tribunal has also mixed the two aspects of puja bonus, namely, whether it is based on an implied term of employment or on custom but it came to the conclusion that there was sufficient evidence to establish custom and therefore ordered payment of one month basic wages as puja bonus. it is, however, clear that puja bonus which is usually paid in bengal is of two kinds namely, where it is paid as an implied term of employment as explained in ahalaxmi cottan mills case and 2 where it is paid as customary and traditional payment as stated in the industrial tribunal award referred to above. at that time it was said on behalf of the company before the industrial tribunal that some bonus was being paid and that there was no intention to discontinue it and conse quently .the tribunal did not adjudicate upon the matter, which shows that the company recognised the traditional and customary nature of the payment and it assured the tribunal that there was no intention then to discontinue the payment. the workmen then contended in their letter of septem ber 2, 953 that the sole object of bonus which had, been granted upto that year was to meet puja expenses and that the payment of this bonus had become customary and term of employment. all the conditions, therefore, of customarv and traditional bonus are satisfied in this case and there is no reason to interfere with the order of the appellate tribunal, though we should like to make it clear that we do not agree with the observations of the appellate tribunal in connection with the profit bonus aspect of the matter. it was also inclined to the view that the company accounts showing loss were not reliable and there might even be case for profit bonus but eventually it granted one month basic wages as customary puja bonus. later the matter was considered in mahalaxmi cottan mills case, where certain tests were laid down which would justify the inference that there was an implied term of employ ment for payment of bonus at the time of the annual durga puja. in the face of such notice year by year it would not be possible to imply term of employment on the basis of an implied agreement, for agreement postulates meeting of minds regarding the subject matter of an agreement and here one party was always making it clear that the payment was ex gratia and that it would not form precedent for future years. in such case, the tribunal will have to consider i whether the payment has been over an unbroken series of years ii whether it has been for sufficiently long period, though the length of the period might depend on the circumstances of each case even so the period may normally have to be longer to justify an inference of traditional and customary puja. lspahani employees union that term may be implied, even though the payment may not have been at uniform rate throughout and the industrial tribunal would be justified in deciding what should be the quantum of payment in particular year taking into account the varying payments made in prvious years. bonus than may be the case with puja bonus based on an implied term of employment iii the chairman of the board of directors of the company visited calcutta in 952 and then on the represehtation of the workmen the advance was converted into one month bonus and even those workmen who had not accepted the advance were allowed to draw the bonus. it cannot therefore be said that there was any break in the payment of bonus from 940 to 952, for if the chairman had not converted what was advance of pay into bonus in december 952, the workmen might ha. ve raised the dispute even in tha. the delay in payment is not in our opinion material in this case, for one of the directors of the company, who appeared as witness, stated as to this one month bonus that it was paid by the company to help its staff during pujas. supreme cour reports 948 to 952, the company whenever it paid this bonus, made it clear that it was an ex gratia payment and would not constitute any precedent for future years. it was pointed out that in four years during this period the payment was made in november and december and not about the time of the pujas and, therefore, it could not be said that this was traditional and customary puja bonus. it seems to have mixed up the discussion on these aspects and having come to the conclusion that puja bonus could not be awarded in this case on the basis of an implied term of employment it proceqded to dismiss the claim on the basis of custom also. in 95, one month bonus was paid in october and half month further bonus was paid in december. that case, however, was concerned with puja bonus as an implied term of employment and not as matter of tradition or custom in bengal."

  "summary": "in the present case the jury had been clearly directed by the sessions judge that corroborative evidence must be evidence which implicates the accused, i.., which confirms in some material particulars not only the evidence that the crime had been committed but also that the appellant had committed it. the state of punjab, 957 ... 953, that the approver evidence had to satisfy double test i.., he must be reliable witness and his evidence must receive sufficient corroboration and in that the corroborating evidence was not sufficient to connect the appellant with the crime. indeed, the sessions judge went to the length of telling the jury that although an approver evidence is strictly admissible and conviction is not illegal merely because it is based on an approver evidence, it was settled rule of practice not to convict person on such evidence except under very rare and excep tional circumstances and usually substantial cor roboratlm was required. apart from the question of corrobora tion of the approver evidence nothing was suggested to us or to the high court in what respect the approver evidence was unreliable after testing his evidence in the same way as one would test the evid ence of any witness for the prosecution in criminal case. it would be in high degree dangerous to attempt to formulate the kind of evidence which would be regarded as corroboration, except to say that corroborative evidence is evidence which shows or tends to show that the story of the accomplice that the accused committed the crime is true, not merely that the crime has been committed, but that it was commit ted by the accused. this court went on to observe, the argument that the character of the approver evid ence has not been considered by the high court cannot be characterised as merely academic or theo retical in the present case because, as we shall presently point out, the evidence of the approver is so thoroughly discrepant that it would be difficult to resist the conclusion that the approver in the present case is wholly unreliable witness. the sessions judge had correctly directed the jury that the corroboration of the evidence of the approver in material parti culars must relate not only to the commission of the crime, but also to the evidence connecting or tending to connect the accused with the crine. indeed it may be legitimate to point out that the learned judges of the high court have themselves criticised the evidence of the approver in dealing with the prosecution case against gurdial singh and have ultimately found that the account given by the approver is unreliable and, though there was circumstantial evidence which raised an amount of suspicion against gurdial singh, that would not be enough to sustain his conviction. the sessions judge in dealing with the evidence of the approver charged the jury as follows before doing so, some established legal principles as regards the approver evidence and the confes sions on which the prosecution has relied in the present case are required to be explained to you. the conviction of the appellant depended on the evidence of the approver and the circumstantial evidence which corroborated him in connecting or tending or connect the appellant with the murder of the deceased sibapada hati. once there was evidence of such circumstances it was for the jury to decide whether they were sufficient corroboration of the approver evidence that the appellant murdered the deceased. it is this corroborative evidence which deter mines the _mind of the court or jury that the approver evidence that the accused committed the crime is true. 32 supreme court reports 960 as to the second submission made by mr. umrigar it is to be remembered that in baskerville case the court of criminal appeal in england after discussing various authorities on the subject came to the follow ing conclusion we hold that evidence in corroboration must be independent testimony which affects the accused by connecting or tending to connect him with the crime. nothing has been shown to us in this case, as was shown in sarwan singh case that apart from the approver testimony in the present case being regarded as tainted evidence his evidence as it stood was in any way unreliable. baskerville , 3 that the circumstantial evidence corroborating the approver was not sufficient to connect the appellant with the murder of the deceased and 4 that on similar corrobor ation of the approver testimony the accused agdish gorain had been acquitted. the moment there is corroborative evidence which connects or tends to connect an accused with the crime such corroborative evidence relates to the identity of the accused in connection with that crime. it must show that he is reliable witness and that his evidence receives sufficient corroboration, 2 that the evidence of an approver must be confirmed not only as to the circumstances of the crime but also as to the identity of the prisoner. as to the 4th submission that although there was similar corroboration of the approver evidence against agdish gorain but he had been acquitted by the jury although no real distinction between his case and the case of the appellant arose is unsound as, in our opinion, the two cases are not comparable. indeed, the high court was of the opinion that these circumstances independent of the direct evidence of the approver would not be sufficient to induce any reasonable person to come to the conclusion that the appellant had committed the crime. supreme court reports 33 evidence, you should bear in mind, is evidence which shows or tends to show hat the story of the accomplice that the accused committed the crime is true. the corroboration need not be direct evidence that the accused committed the crime it is suffici ent if it is merely circumstantial evidence of his connection with the crime. in other words, the jury were told not to convict the appellant on the approver evidence unless his evidence had been substantially corroborated. 36 supreme court reports 960 the crime and accordingly the approver evidence that the appellant did commit the crime was true. it is, however, urged by mr. umrigar that the circumstances mentioned were not circumstances corroborating the evidence of the approver in material particulars which would connect or tend to connect the appellant with the crime. it would seem that on the approver evidence the jury may well have regarded the circumstances as insufficient corroboration to connect or tending to connect agdish gorain with the crime. as to the 3rd submission made on behalf of the appellant the following circumstances were established by the evidence which were accepted by the jury there was motive for the appellant to commit the crime, that is to say, his immoral proposal to lila, wife of the deceased. as already stated, however, the approver evidence is the direct evidence which establishes that the appellant had murdered the deceased. there should be corroboration in material particulars not only concerning the crime but corrobor ation of the approver story by evidence whi9h connects or tends to connect an accused with the crime. obviously, it was never suggested that the approver evidnce in this case was entirely unreliable, if his evidence was tested in the same way as the evidence of any prosecution witness in criminal trial. in our opinion, all the circumstances referred to above were sufficient corroboration of the approver evidence connecting or tending to connect the appellant with i959 nantndra allt ghose . supreme court reports 29 evidence in corroboration must be independent testimony, which affects the accused by connecting or tending to connect the accused with the crime. in other words, it must be evidence which implicates him, that is, which conforms in some material parti culars not only the evidence that the crime has been committed but also that the prisoner accused committed it. corroborative evidence, you should bear in mind, is evidence which shows or tends to show that the story of the accomplice that the accused committed the crime is true. corrobora tion must be as to the crime and the identity of each one of the accused and the corroboration requir ed must be independent evidence, that is reliable evidence of another kind. ..."

  "summary": "consistently with its policy, the act, which provides for overtime wages for employees in all establishments, provides for overtime wages for employees in factories as well by making the relevant provisions of the factories act applicable to them. section 63 of the act deals with this topic ... section 63 provides for the payment of overtime work at the rate of times the ordinary rate of ges in the case of employees in any establishment other than residential hotel, restaurant, or eatinghouse, whereas sub. 2 provides for wages for overtime at the rate of twice the ordinary rate of wages in respect of employees in residential hotel, restaurant or eating house, subject to the other conditions specified in the said section. section 70 provides that nothing in this act shall be deemed to apply to any person employed in or within the precincts of factory and the provisions of the factories act shall, notwithstanding anything in the said act, apply to such person. 2 of the factories act defines factory as meaning any premises including the precincts thereof i whereon ten or more workers are working, or were working on any day of the preceding twelve months, and in any part of which manufacturing process is being carried on with the aid of power, or is ordinarily so carried on, or ii whereon twenty or more workers are working, or were working on aiiy day of the preceding twelve months, and in any part of which manufacturing process is being carried on without the aid of power, or is ordinarily so carried on, but does not include mine subject to the opera tion of the mines act, 952 xxxv of 952, or railway running shed ands. 70 of the act it is clear that the first part of the section excludes factory and its employees from the operation of the act but the second part makes the relevant provisions of the factories act applicable to them. hira, works manager, central rail way workshop and factory, pa.rel, bombay hereafter called the appellant by the employees at the said factory hereafter called the respondents under the payment of wages act, 936 iv of 936 claiming payment of overtime wages since 948. in the result, the finding made by the authority was that timekeepers are employees of the workshop, but are not workers under the factories act while the progress time keepers can claim the status of workers under the said act. ... it is true that the definition of establish ment does not expressly exclude factory but it is plain that factory is treated by the act as separate and distinct and there can be no doubt that the provisions in the act which apply to establishment are not intended to, and do not, apply to factories. these appeals by special leave arose from applications made by the respondents, who were employed as timekeepers in the time office of the central railway workshop and factory, parel, bombay, claiming payment of overtime wages under the payment of wages act, 936 . it is conceivable that kitchen attached to an establishment like residential hotel may satisfy the definition of factory but it seems to us that such an adjunct of an establishment is prima facie not intended by the act to be treated apart and separately from the main establishment itself and so it would be taken as part of the establishment and be governed by the provisions of the act in relation thereto. overtime

entitled to claim overtime wages as provided for by that act. this part provides that the provisions of the factories act shall .pply to the persons in question notwithstanding anything contained in the said act. 7 thus serves the purpose of clarifying the position thatthe factories act is made applicable to employees in factories and that they are not governed by any of the jrovisions of the act. 2 of the factories act and the rest were merely employees of the workshop, but the authority accepted the alternative case made by the respond ents and directed the appellant to file statement showing the overtime wages due to each of the respondents and ordered it to pay the same. it is not disputed by the appellant that the bombay legislature was competent to prescribe for the extension of the provisions of the factories act to employees in the factories within the territory of the state of bombay and since sanction for this legislation has been duly obtained from the governorgeneral of india on january 3, 949, no question about ll.ny repugnance between the provi sions of . the authority under the payment of wages act found that only four of the respondents, who were required to do the work of progress timekeepers, could claim the status of workers within the meaning of . the legislature knew that in fact the act contained no provision which in terms or expressly applies to any such person but in order to remove any possible doubt it has provided that no provision in the act shall even by inference or fiction be deemed to apply to them. 70 supplement the provisions of the factories act by extending them to all employees in factories like the respondents though they are not workers under . 70 of the act the provisions of the factories act, . 70 has provi ded .liat notwithstanding the said provision the relevant provsions of the factories act will apply to persons employed in factory. establishment is defind as meaning shop, commercial establishment, residential hotel, restaurant, eatinghouse, theatre or other place of public amuse ment are entertainment to which the act applies and includes such other establishment as the state govern ment may by notification in the official gazette declare i published in the bombay government gazette, part iv. section 59 of the factories act also deals with the question of extra. wages for overtime. the authority held that the time office where the timekeepers work is an integ ral part of the factory and so it came to the conclusion that the timekeepers are employed in the factory called the central railway workshop and factory, parel, bombay. ii and the entry against it in col. 3 of the said schedule shows that the provisions of the act are inapplicable to the said establishments. appeals by

  "summary": "4 if any bill pending at the commencement of this constitution in the legislature of state has, after it has been passed by such legislature, been reserved for the consideration of the president and has received his assent, then, notwithstanding any thing in this constitution, the law so assented to shall not be called in question in any court on the ground that it contravenes the provisions of clause 2. 5 nothing in clause 2 hall affect the provisions of any existing law other than law to which the provisions of clause 6 apply, or the provisions of any law which the state may hereafter make i for the purpose of imposing or levying any tax or penalty, or ii for the promotion of public health or the pre vention of danger to life or property, or iii in pursuance of any agreement entered into between the government of the dominion of india or the government of india and the government of any other country, or otherwise, with respect to property declared by law to be evacuee property ....... , 3. saving of laws providing for acquisition of estates, etc. notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provision of this part no law providing for the acquisition by the state of any .state or of any rights therein or for the extinguishment or modifica tion of any such rights, shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by any provi sions of this part ..... das finally urges that if the obligation to provide for compensation is not implicit in the word acquisition in entry 36 in list ii and if that obliga tion is not to be read into that entry even in view of the words subject to .............. at the end of it, even then if the state exercises its power to make law with respect to acquisition of property under entry 36 in list ii it is the duty of the state legisla ture to make law also with respect to matjters speci fied in entry 42 in list iii on the principles that as . ..., ... supreme court reports 977 entry 42 in list iii confers power on the legisla ture for the protection of the interest of persons whose property is compulsunly acquired, such power must, therefore, be regarded as coupled with duty to exer cise it. and, therefore, the alleged requirement of public purpose under entry 42 in list iii cannot be said to be incorporated in entry 33 in list i. it would, there fore, follow that whereas under entry 36 in list ii which is to be read with entry 42 in list iii by reason of the words subject to etc. in entry 36 in list ii the legislature of state can only make law for compulisory acquisition of property for public pur pose, parliament may, under entry 33 in llst i which does not attract entry 42 in list iii, make law for compulsory acquisition of property without public purpose. we find that under article 246 parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect, inter ulia, to matters specified in entry 33 in list i, namely, acquisition or requisitioning of property for the pur poses of the union, that the state legislatures have exclusive power to make laws with respect, inter alia, to matters specified in entry 36 in list ii, namely, the acquisition or requisitioning of property except for the purposes of the union subject to the provision of entry 42 of list iii and that both parliament and the state legislatures may make laws with respect to matters set forth in entry 42 in list iii, namely, the principles for determining the compensation and the form and manner of giving such compensation. per patanjali sastri . ., mahajan, mukherjea, di. and chandrasekhara aiyar jj.i the bihar land reforms act, xxx of 950, is not law in respect of matter mention ed in entry 8 of list ii, viz., lands and land tenures, but law in respect of acquisition of property, matter covered by entry 36 of list ii. ii the obligation to pay compensation for property acquired by the state is not an obligation imposed by entry 36 of list ii read by itself or in conjunction with entry 42 of list iii or by the spirit of the constitution. if the require ment of public purpose were not provision of article 3 2, then it will obviously lead us to the un tenable conclusion that parliament will be free under its residuary powers under article 248 and entry 97 of list i of the seventh schedule to make law for ac quiring private property without any public purpose at all and to the still more absurd result that while parliament will have to provide for compensation under article 3 2 in law made by it for acquisitio of property for public purpose it will not have to make any provision for compensation in law made for acquisition of property to be made without public purpose. 984 supreme court reports 952 anything in this constitution occurring therein will also protect the act even against the alleged legislative incompetency arising out of the non compliance with all provisions of the constitution relating to the payment of compensation or the exist ence of public purpose including the supposed re quirement of producing actual compensation said to be implicit in the provisions of entry 42 in list iii. in my judgment, the act cannot be called in question on the ground of legislative incompetence of the bihar legislature to enact it under entry 36 in list ii or entry 42 in list iii. may be taken possession of or acquired for public purposes under any law auhorising the taking of such possession or such acquisition if the law provide for compensation for the property taken possession of or acquired ............ put in the above form, the clause makes it clear at once and beyond any shadow of doubt that there are three limitations imposed upon the power of the state, namely, that the taking of possession or acquisition of property must be for public purpose, 2 that such taking of possession or acquisition must be under law authorising such taking of possession or acquisition and 3 that the law must provide for compensation 952 the state of bihar . the scheme of our constitution obviously is to provide the three things separately, namely, the power of making law for acquisition of property in article 246 read with entry 33 in list i and entry 36 in list ii, the obligation of such law to provide for compensation in article 3 2 and the power of making law laying down the principles for determining such compen sation in article 246 read with entry 42 in list iii. ... .. if that entry by it self or read with entry 42 in list iii has any impli cation as suggested, namely, that law for acquisition of property made under entry 36 in list ii without provision for compensation wijll be beyond the legis lative compentency of the state legislatures, then there is no other entry under which such law can be made by state legislature and there can, therefore, be no point in making proivision in article 34 for protecting, against article 32, law which, on this hypothesis, cannot be made at all. das argument would lead to this anomal ous result that while the obligation to provide for compensation is made part of the legislative power under entry 36 in list ii by virtue of its last few words quoted above, no such obligation is attractedt and made part of the legislative power under entry 33 in list i, and that, therefore, in making law with respect to acquisition of property under entry 33 in list i parliament, unlike the state legislatures, will not be bound to provide for any compensation at all. das attack on the vires of the act mainly rests on the contention that it is implicit within the language of entry 36 of list ii of the seventh schedule of the constitution that pro perty could not be acquired without payment of com pensation, the only effect of compulsory power of acquisition against the individual being that there is the power to oblige him to sell and convey property when the public necessities require it, but that the power to take compulsorily raises by implication right to payment in other words, there is con comitant obligation to pay and the power to acquire is inseparable from the obligation to pay compen sation and as the provisions of the statute in respect of payment of compensation are illusory, it is uncon stitutional. das contentions were correct, law for the promotion of health or the prevention of danger to life or property involving the acquisition of property without provision for compensation, which is what is sought to be protected from article 3 2, can never be made, for the obligation to provide for compensa tion is, according to him, implicit in entry 36 in list ii, by itself or read with entry 42 in list iii, and there is no other entry under which law may be made by state legislature with respect to acquisi fon of property. 980 supreme court reports 952 the obligation to provide for compensation being, as i hold, provision of article 3 2 and not being im plicit or part and parcel of the legislative power itself under entry 36 in list ii read by itself or in conjunction with entry 42 in list iii, the impugned act cannot, by virtue of article 3 4, 3 and 3, be called in question on the ground that it contravenes or is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by the provisions of clause 2 of de 3, that is to say, that it does not provide for compensation. assuming that the necessity for the existence of public purpose is not provision of article 3 2 but is provision only of entry 36 in list ii andor of entry 42 in list iii and that consequently articles 3 4 , 3 and 3 do not preclude the respondents from challenging the validity of the act on the ground of the legislative incompetency arising out of the absence of public purpose, the question still remains whether there is in fact public purpose within the meaning of our constitution to support the act. if state legislature in making law for the acquisition of property for public purpose under entry 36 in list ii must pro vide for compensation then law made conformably with this supposed requirement of that entry by state legislature will require no protection ar all agalnst article 3 2, and article 3 must be regard ed as meaningless and unnecessary. implicit in entry 36 in list ii and that the existence of public purpose is also re quirement of entry 42 in list iii which is made part of entry 36 in list ii by virtue of the words subject to etc., appearing at the end of that entry and his conclusion is that in the absence of public purpose the bihar legislature had no legislative com petency under those two entries to enact the impug ned act and that this ground of attack, is still available , ... possibly under the impression that the sacredness of private property should not be confided to the un certain virtues of the party in power for the time being, the constitutionmakers of our country have declared it as one of the fundamental rights that no property shall be taken possession of or acquired for public purpose unless the law directing its appropriation makes provision for compensation in the manner laid down in article 3 2. clause 4 of article 3 does not do away with the obligation to pay compensation it merely lays down that laws which are referred to in clause 3 of the article would be immune from judi cial scrutiny on the ground of inadequacy of the i vi de cooley on constitutional limitations, vol. ii, . having held that the bihar act is constitutional as regards transfer of estates to the state and that this is mainly an enactment under legislative head 36 of lis ii, it is convenient now to examine the conten tion of mr. das to the effect that in the contents of the power conferred on the legislature by this entry their exists concomitant obligation to pay compen sation and that as the provisions regarding payment of compensation are illusory, the act i unconstitutional and that article 3 4 of the constitution does not afford any protection against this attack. it is also said that the bihar legislature had legislated both under entry 36 and entry 42 and intended to take the property conditional on payment of compensation but if it transpires that the provisions it has made about payment of compensation are illusory, then that part of the act would be void and as it could not have been intended by the legislature to pass the act in any truncated form in which it would remain if the provi sions regarding compensation are taken out of it, the whole act should be held unconstitutional. this head of legislation seems to have been expressly mentioned in the concurrent list not only in view of the accepted principle of law that in cases of compul sory acquisition of property compensation has to be made but also in view of the clear and mandatory provisions of article 32 which require that law authorising the taking or acquisition of propeny will be void if it does not provide for payment of compen sation for the property acquired or does not either fix the amount of compensation or specify the principles on which and the manner in which the compensation is to be determined and given. further, it must be borne in mind that article 3 4 which applies notwithstanding any thing in this constitution, will, by force of the very words, protect the act against everi legislative in competency, if any arising out of the alleged non compliance with the suggested implied provisions, if any, of entry 36 in list ii and entry 42 in list iii. in my judgment the respondents are not, by reason of articles 3 4, 3 and 3, entitled to call the act in question on the ground that it does not provide for compensation, whether the ground formulated as breach of article 3 2 or of the implied provision, if any,. on the other hand, even if i is held that no principle has, in fact, been laid down by the act, as contended, then that fact not only amounts to breach of the provisions of entry 42 in list iii but also constitues breach of the provi sions of article 3 2 which clearly and emphatically re quires the law to either fix the compensation or lay down the principles on which and the manner in which the compensation is to be given and breach of this provision, call it provision of article 3 2 or one of entry 42 in list iii, cannot, for reasons already stated be questioned in view of articles 3 4, 3 and 3. there can be no. manner of doubt that acquisition of private property by legislation under entries 33, 36 and 42 can only be made either for purposes of the union or for purposes of the state or for public purpose and that it is un ecessary to state in express terms in the statute itself tne precise purpose for which property is being taken, nrovided from the whole tenor and intenlment of the act it could be gathere that the property was being acquired either for purposes of the state or for pur poses of the public and that the intention was to benefit the community at large. the words sub ject to the provisions of entry 42 of list iii in entry 36 reinforce the argument, as these words must be taken to mean that the power to make law with respect to acquisition of property should be exercised subject to the condition that such law should also provide for the matters referred to in entry 4 2, in other words, twofold restriction as to public purpose and payment . das that the obligation to pay compensation is implicit in the language of entry 36 of list ii of the seventh schedule and that the power to take compulsorily raises by implication right to payment, the power to acquire being inseparable from the obligation to pay compensation, it is necessary to examine briefly the origin of the power of the state on the subject of compulsory acquisition of property. the words subject to in entry 36 of list ii only mean that whenever law is made by state legislature in exercise of its legislative power under entry 36, that law will be subject to the provisions of law made by the parliament under entry 42 of list iii. notwithstanding anything in the fore saving of laws going provisions of this part, no law proi.ding for ac providing for the acquisition by the rqmsitton of estates, state of any estate or of any rights etc. therein or for the extinguishment or modification of any such rights shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by any provisions of this part provided that where such law is law made by the legislature of state, the provisions of this article shall not apply thereto unless such law, having been reserved for the consideration of the president, has recdved his assent. this principle is embodied in article 3 2 of our constitution in these terms prop_erty, iiovable or immovajle, including any mterest , or any company ownmg, any com mercial or industrial undertaking, shall be taken pos session of or acquired for public purposes under any law authorising the taking of such possession or such acquisition, unless the law provides for compensation for the property taken possession of or acquired and either fixes the amount of the compensation, or specifies the principles on which, and the manner in which, the compensation js to be determined and given. assuming that the obligation to pay compensation which is expressly provided in article 3 2 is also implicit in entry 36 in list ii by itself or read with entry 42 in list iii the respo!ldents cannot, even then, be permitted to call in question the validity of the impugned act on the ground that it does not pro vide for compensation, for then they will be doing exactly what they are forbidden to do by article 3 4 and the newly added articles. do not import that obligation as stated above, entry 42 in list iii should, nevertheles, be construed as conferring power coupled with duty, so that if the lawmaking power under entry 33 in list i or entry 36 in list ii is at all exercised, the law making power under entry 42 in list the question for consideration is whether this obligation to pay compensation for compulsory acquisition of property has been impliedly laid down by the constitution makers in our constitution under legislative head in entry 36 of list ii and entry 33 of list i, or whether this all important obligation which follows ocmpulsory acquisition as shadow has been put in express and clear terms somewhere else in the constitution. mahajan. 932 supreme court reports 952 lastly, it was urged that the legislative power conferred in entry 42 of the concurrent list is power conferred for the benefit of the expropriated owner and that the legislature is bound to exercise this power for his benefit whenever it takes property under its compulsory powers, in other words, it was said that the power conferred by the entry was coupled with duty to exercise it. mr. sanjiva chowdhuri has urged that the land acquisition act, 894 being continued by the con stitution and that act which is central act having been extended by notilication in 899 to ramgarh state for which he appears, the central act must apply to ramgarh until the notification is withdrawn and the impugned act cannot apply for determining the compensation, for the field is already occupied by the central act of 894. notwithstanding anything in the fore going provisions of this part, no law providing for the acquisition by the state of any estate or of any rights therein or for the extinguishment or modification of any such rights shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by any pro visions of this part provided that where such law is law made by the legislature of state, the provisions of this article shall not apply thereto unless such law, having been reserved for the consideration the presi dent has received his assent. if the acquisition of th zamindaries and the tenures is, as i hold, dictated or inspired by the sound public purpose of ameliorating the economic and political conditions of the actual tenants, the self same public purpose may well require the acquisition of the arrears of rent so as to avert the undesirable but inevitable consequences i have men tioned the bihar legislature obviouslly thought that the tenants in arears will have better treatment and more reasonable accommodation, in the matter of the liquidation of the huge arrears, from the state which will act under the guidance of the land com mission than from the expropriated landlords whose sole surviving interest in their erstwhile tenants will only be to realise as much of the arrears as they can from the tenants and within the shortest possible time without any mercy or accommodation. secondly, the argument based on the words subject to etc. at the end of entry 36 in list ii which are supposed to import the provisions of entry 42 in list iii into entry 36 in list ii is not wellfounded and it becomes obvious when we look at entry 33 in list i. there are no words at the end of that entry as subject to etc. and i repeat that the obligation to provide for compensation is not implicit in entry 36 list ii by itself or read with entry 42 in lisit iii but is to be found only in article 3 2, that under entry 42 in list iii the act has laid down principle for determining compensa tion and, therefore, there can be no question as to legislative incompetency for any alleged noncompli ance with any supposed requirement said to be im plicit . entry 36 of list ii read with article 2463 was obviously in tended to authorise state legislature to exercise the right of eminent domain, that is, the right of compul sory acquisition of private property, the exercise of such power has been recognised in the jurisprudence of all civilised countries as conditioned by public neces sity and payment of compensation. that entry cannot possibly be regarded as legislative head for acquisition of property and much less is the purpose or province of that entry to lay down any requirement of public purpose as condition precedent for the 952 the state of bihar maharaja dhiraja sir kameshwar singh of darbhanga and others. even if the court does not accept the correct ness of the arguments based on entry 36 in list ii and entry 42 in list iii and holds the respondents barred from going into the question of compensation by reason of articles 34, 3 and 3 the respondents are still entitled to challenge the act on the ground that the proposed acquisition is not for public purpose. . if entry 42 in list iii were, by reason of the words subject to the provisions of entry 42 of list iii occurring in entry 36 in list ii, to be read as having been made part of the content of entry 36 in list ii then it may well be argued that, in view of article 246, . one of the provilions 0f the constitution is article 3 2 under which no pro perty can be taken possession of or acquired for public purposes under any law authorising the taking of such possession or such acquisition unless the law provides for compensation for the property and either fixes the amount of compensation or specifies the principles on which, and the mamer in which, the compensation is to be determined and given. as regards section 23 the bihar land reforms act, my learned brother has based his decision on the ground that the provision of this clause constitutes fraud on the constitution, and although in enacting the provision, the legislature purported to exer cise its powers under entry 42 of the legisla tive list iii in schedule vii of the constitution, in reality i is colourable exercise of that power under which thing has been done wliich is not contempleted by that entry at all and lies outside its ambit. the argument is that the constitution has left to parliament or the state legislature the duty of specify ing the principle on which, and the form and manner in which the compensation is to be determined and given but the bihar legislature by section 3 22 of the act has simply provided that the amount of com pensation shall be paid i cash or in bonds or partly in cash and partly in bonds and that the bonds shall be either negotiable or nonnegotiable and nontrans ferable and be payable in forty equal instalments and has not laid down any decisive provision but has left the matter to the state government to decide. mr. choudhury contended that the field of legislation on the question of principles of determination of compensation and the mode and manner of payment of such compensation was already occupied by the land acquisition act which was an existing law of parliament and, refore, the state legislature could not enter on this field and legislate on the principles of payment of compensation. i am therefore of the opinion that mr. das is not right in his contention that unless adequate provision is made by law en acted under legislative power conferred by entry 36 of list i for compensation, the law is unconstitutional as entry 36 itself does not authorize the making of such law without providing for compensation. das. 974 supreme court reports 952 necessity of constitutional law that i know of, or that has been brought to our notice, which requires that the obligation to pay compensation for the acquisition of property must be made part and parcel of the very legislative power to make law with respect to the compulsory acquisition of private property. supreme court reports under clause 5 and, what is more important, as soon i the interest of the community so requires, the state may, under article 3, deprive the owner of his property by authority of law subject to payment of compensation if the deprivation is by way of acquisi tion or requisition of the property by the state. assuming however that entry 36 of list ii is wide enough to include acquisition of money or right of action, i have no hesitation in holding that in qrvid ing for compensation in respect of such acquisition the legislature has made colourable use of entry 4 oi list iii and has thereby defeated the purpose of that entry altogether. under heads 2 and 3 of sub clause must necessarily be referable to, and derive their competence from the legislative power under entry 36 of list ii, in so far as they purport to autho rise acquisition of any property, for the police power of the state is only the general power to regulate and control the exercise of private rights and lioerties in the interests of the community and does not represent any specific head of legislative power. if the principles so laid down in the act do not in any rare case produce any com pensation or do not produce adequate compensation in some cases, such absence of compensation may be contravention of article 3 2 but in view of articles 3 4, 3 and 3 and particularly due to the words notwithstanding anything in this constitu tion occurring in article 3 4 it cannot be made ground of attack on the act, even though such ground is formulated in different but attractive language, namely, as fraud on the constitution. , 898 supreme court reports 952j 68 and bill could become law only after the governor assented to it under article 200, clause 3 of article 3 must be taken to require that state law authorising compulsory acquisition of property should reieive the governor as well as the president assent, the former to mab it law and the latter to give it effect. in exercise of legislative power under entry 36 was conditional on the simultaneous exercise of the legislative power under entry 42 and because there has been no valid exercise of this power the pro visions of the impugned act regarding the determina tion of compensation being illusory, the legislation under entry 36 fails. nor is it necessary to examine whether the scheme of compensation provided for by the statutes is so illusory as to leave the expropriated owners without any real compensation for loss of their .. property. .. turning now to the special points ansmg in parti cular cases, it was urged by mr. das that section 4 of the bihar act, which provides that all arrears of rent, royalti and cesses due for any period prior to the date of the vesting of the estates in government shall vest and be recoverable by the state was un constitutional and void. these provisions, so far as they are material here, i that law with respect to acquisition of property hould authorize acquisition only for ...., public purpose and ii that such law should provide for compensation, etc. mr. das, while admitting that 952 the state of hihar . it was said that the words subject to the provisions of entry 42 in list iii must be taken to mean that the lawmaking power under entry 36 could only be exercised subject to the two conditions as to public purpose and payment of compensation, both of which are referred to in entry. das, leading counsel for the zamin dars, accordingly based his main argument in these proceedings on entry 36 of list ii and entry 42 of list iii which read as follows 36. acquisition or requisitioning except for the purposes of the union, provisions of entry 42 of list iii. of property, subject to the 42. in the face of the limitations on the state power of compulsory acquisition hus incor porated in the body of the constitution, from which estates alone are excluded, it would, in my opinion, be contrary to elementary canons of statutory con struction to read, by implication, those very limita tions into entry 36 of list ii, alone or in conjunction with entry 42 of list iii of the seventh schedule, or to deduce them from the spirit of the constitution, and that, too, in respect of the very properties excluded. both legislatures can legislate under entry 42 but the parliamentary statute made in exercise of powers under this entry would have pre ference over state law in case of repugnancy and it was for this reason that reference was made to entry 42 in the head of legislation mentioned in the state list under entry 36. this vesting of the arrears of rent in the state necessarily implies the transfer of the rights of the proprietors or tenure holders to the state and this process must, therefore, amount to the acquisition of that right by the state, therefore, in effect, the act does contemplate the acquisition of the arrears of rent by the state. das suggests, in the alternative, that if the obligation to provide for compensation is not implicit in the word acquisition itself as used in entry 36 in list ii that obligation is tracted and made part and pared of that entry by reason of the words subject to the provisions of entry 42 of list iii. 936 supreme court reports 952 acquisition of property compulsorily for public purpose but the barring provisions of article 34 lo not in any way touch the powers of the court to see whether the acquisition has been made for public purpose. for compesation, for otherwise there can be no occas0n or necessity for ... supreme court reports 979 any protection against article 3 2. law of this kind, in so far as such law provides for acquisition of property, must necessarily be made by state legis lature, if at all, under entry 36 in list ii. , article 3 relates only to the acquisition of parti cular kind of property, viz., estates and rights there in, and what is more important for our present purpose, the non obstante clause in article 3 4 over rides all other provisions in the constitution including the list of the seventh schedule, whereas law which falls within the purview of article 3 could only prevail over the foregoing provisions of this part. it was argued that, whik the constitution conferred power on the legislatures under entry 42 of list iii to make laws with respect to the principles on which compensa tiop for property acquired was to be determined and the form and the mauner wji.ich such compensation was to be given, it was not com petent for the bihar legislature to delegate this essen tial legislative power to the executive government. it is urged that article 3 2 assumes law authorising the taking of possession or the acquisition of property for public purpose and provides that the property shall not be taken possession of or acquired even for that public purpose unless the law also provides for compensa tion. it is, therefore, concluded that the only pro vision of article 3 2 is that the law autho rising the taking of possession or the acquisition of property for public purpose must provide for compensation and it is this provision only that cannot be made ground of attack on the act by reason of articles 3 4, 3 and 3 of the constitution. das. 964 supreme court reports 952 das .the proceedings out of which these appeals have arisen were initiated by different proprietors of estates in bihar challenging the constitutional validity of the bihar land reforms act, 950 bihar act xxx of 950 which will hereafter in this judgment be referred to as the act. the express provision in article 3 2 that law of acquisition, in order to be valid, must provide for compensation, will, therefore, necessarily exclude all suggestion of an implied obligation to provide for compensation sought to be impo.i.ted into the meaning of the word acquisition in entry 36 in list ii. that the obligation to provide for compensation is not included in the content of the legislative power u_nder entry 36 in list ii, by itself or read with entry 42 in list iii, will be made further clear when we come to consider closely clauses 4 and 5 of article 3 and article 3. in other words, it only means that whenever law is made by state legislature in exer cise of its legislative power under entry 36, that law will be subject to the provisions of parliamentary statute made in exercise of its legislative powers under entry 42 of the nncurrent list. the provisions of articles 34 and 3 and 3, though they deprive the expropriated proprietor of his rights provided in part iii of the constitution, do not in any way affect the ambit of entry 36 and empower the state legislature to make law for compulsory acquisition of property without payment of compensation in the true sense of that term. further, the impugned act purports to acquire all arrears of rent and la for acquisition of the arrears of rent cannot possibly be said to be law with respect to matters specified in entry 8 in list ii for it cannot be supposed to be law relating to the collection of rent within the meaning of that entry. there is no doubt that land in entry 8 in list ii has been construed in very wide way but if land or land tenures in that entry is held to cover acquisition of land also, then entry 36 in list ii will have to be held as wholly redundant, so far as acquisition of land is concerned, conclusion to which i am not prepared to assent. supreme court reports 975 according to this scheme it is not necessary at all to regard entry 33 in list i and entry 36 in list ii, which are mere heads of legislative power, as contain ing within themselves any obligafion to provide for the payment of compensation. in the view i have expressed above that the objec tions based on the lack of public purpose and the failure to provide for payment of just compensation are barred under article 34 and are also devoid of of merits, it becomes unnecessary to consider what is public purpose and whether the acquisition autho rised by the impugned statutes subserves any public purpose. supreme court reports 987 being implicit in entry 36 in list ii and entry 42 in list iii and holds that the respondents are, by reason of the provisions of articles 3 4, 3 and 3, debarred from questioning the validity of the act on the ground that it does not provide for compen .i.tion article 3 2 requires that the law authorising the taking poss,ession or the acquisi tion of land for public purpose should provide for compensation for the property taken possession of or acquired and should either fix the amount or specify the principles on which, and the manner in which the compensation is to be determined and given. das argument and to avoid the complica tion arising out of the residuary powers of parliament under article 248 and entry 97 of list ii i have taken the case of law otf acquisition made by the legislatures of state which also come within article 34. if the provision of clause 2 of article 3 as to the necessity for the existence of public purpose as prerequisite to compulsory acquisi tion of property is also to be regarded as implicit in those two legislative entries, surely articles 3 4, 3 and 3 and in particular article 3 4 which contain the words notwithstanding anything in this constitution will protect the act from such implied prov!!on, for reasons i have already explained. for if the restrictive condi tions as to public purpose and pay_ment of compensa tion are to be derived only from those words, then it must follow that in the absence of those words in entry 33, parliament can make laws authorising acquisition or requisitioning of property without public purpose and provision for compensation. article 34 postu lates law which offends against 32 and so far as the state legislatures are concerned there is no entry in list ii except entry 36 under which such an offending law may made by the state legislatures. whatever may be the position as regards the acquisition of money as such, it is not correct to say that law made under entry 36 of list ii cannot authorise acquisition of choses in action like arrears of rent due from the tenants which are covered by the term property used in that entry and in article 3. to cut at the root of the above argument the learned attorneygeneral appearing for the appellant state contends that the impugned act is law made with respect to matters mentioned in entry 8 in list ii and not under entry 36 in list ii. vii, list ii, entries 8, 36 and list ill, entry 42constructionspirit of the constitution right of eminent

supreme court reports 943 proposition of law that property of individuals can not be appropriated by the state under the power of compulsory acquisition for the mere purpose of adding to the revenues of the state. supreme court reports 899 only objections bas on alleged infringements of the fundamental rights conferred by part iii, but if, from the other provisions thereof it could be inferred that there must be public purpose and payment of com pensation before private property could be compul sorily acquired by the state, there was npthing in the two articles aforesaid to preclude objection on the ground that the impugned acts do not satisfy these requirements and are, therefore, unconstitutional. this term seems to have been originated in 625 by hugo grotius, who wrote of this power in his work de jure belli et pacis as follows the property of subjects is under the eminent domain of the state, so that the state or he who acts for it may use and even alienate and destroy such property, not only in the case of extreme necessity, in which even private persons have right over the property of others, but for ends of public utility, to which ends those who founded civil society must be supposed to have intended that private ends should give way. article 34 is in these terms lf any bill pending at the commencement of this constitution in the legislature of state has, after it has been passed by such legislature, been reserved for the consideration of the president and has received his assent, then, notwithstanding anything in this constitution, the law so assented to shall not be called in question in any court on the ground that it contravenes the provisions of clause 2. . the question at once arises as to whether there is any legislative entry in list ii under which law for acquisition or taking possession of property without compensation can be made by state legislature. the language of article 3 4 is unequivocal in its terms and states that when bill has received the assent of the president according to the procedure prescribed in article 33 and 4 then, notwithstand ing anything in this constitution, the law so assented to shall not be called in question in any court on the ground that it contravenes the provisions of clause 2. in order to determine the scope of this clause, it is necessary to determine what are the specific provisions of clause 2 which clause 4 makes unjusticiable. 3. without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in article 3, none of the acts and regulations specified in the ninth schedule nor any of the provisions thereof shall be deemed to be void or even to have become void, on the ground that such act, regulation or provision is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by any provisions of this part, and notwithstanding any jmlgment, decree or order of any court or tribunal 952 the state of bihar . entry 42 of list iii speaks of principles on which compensation for property acquired or requisitioned for the purposes of the union or of state or any other public purpose is to be sec cooley on constitutional limitations, vol. ii, . the entry reads tfius principles on which compensation for property acquired or requisitioned for purposes of the union or of state or for any other public purpose is to be determined, and the form and manner in which such compensation is to be given. firstly, it was said that the constitution having _in entry 42 of list iii of the seventh schedule vested authority in the legislature to make laws on the question of the principles as to the payment of compensation and the manner and form of its payment, in other words, it , ving trusted these matters to the care, judgment and wisdom of the legislature, it had no power to delegate these matters to the executive. 958 supreme court reports 952 such attracts the operation of clause 4 of that article, my learned brother has takien the view that the bar created by cleause 4 is confined to the ques tion of compensation only and does not extend to the existence or necessity of public purpose which, though implicit in, has not been expressly provided for by clause 2 of the article. mahajan .this is an appeal under article 323 of the constitution of india from judgment of the full bench of the high court of judicature at patna, dated the 2th march, 95, whereby the high court declared the bihar land reforms act, 950, ultra vires on the ground of its infringement of article 4 of the constitution, but decided against the respondent on all other points. 02 supreme court reports 952 acquisition by the state of any estate or of any rights therein or for the extinguishment or modification of any such rights shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by any provisions of this parr provided that where such law is law made by the legislature of . supreme court reports 97 said bihar land reforms act and praying fur writ in the nature of mandamus to be issued on the state of bihar restraining it from acting in any man ner by virtue of, or under the provisions of, the said act. 968 supreme court reports 952 list iii the bihar legislature had no power to enact the said act inasmuch as it makes no provision for the payment of just compensation . as the act has been held invalid by the high court solely on the ground that it violated the provisions of article 4 of the constitution, the basis of the judgment declaring the act to be unconstitutional is no longer tenable and it has therefore to be reversed in case this court agrees with the decision of the high court oii the points decided against the respondent. the only purpose of the words subject to occuring in entry 36 is to indicate that legislation under entry 36 would be subject to any law made by parliament in exercise of its legislative power under entry 42 of the concurrent list. the fact is that the lawmaking power of both parlia ment and state legislatures can be exercised only subject to the aforesaid two restrictions, not by reason of anything contained in the entries themselves, but by reason of the positive provisions of article 3 2, and, as laws falling under article 3 4 or under articles 3 and 3 cannot be called in question in court of law for noncompliance with those pre visions, such laws cannot be struck down as uncon stitutional and void. das reads the words subject to as meaning conditional upon the exercise of the legislative power under entry 42 in list iii, that is to say, conditional upon fulfilling the obligation to provide for compensation and the form and the manner in which such compensation is to be given. on plain reading of entry 36 in list ii the power to make law with respect to matters specified therein is subject to, that is to say, conditional upon the exercise of legislative power under entry 42 in list iii. clause 4 of that article postulates law authorising acquisition of property but contravening the provisions of clause 2, that is, without public purpose or pay ment of compensation. section 4 of the bihar land reforms act lays down, as one of the results of the publication of notification under section 3 of tle act that all arrears of rents........ and all cesses together with interest, if any, due thereon for any period prior to the date of vesting which were recoverable in respect of the estate or tenure by the proprietor or tenure holder and the recovery of which was not barred by any law of limitation shall vest in and be recoverable by the state. for all these reasons the state legislatures, it was claimed, had no power to make law for acquisition of property with out fulfilling the two conditions as to public purpose .and payment of compensation. some courts have gone so far in the direction of liberal construction as to hold that public use is synonymous with public benefit, public utility, or public advantage, and to authorise the exercise of the power of eminent domain to pro mote such public benefit, etc., especially where the interests involved are of considerable magni tude, and it is sought to use the power in order that the natural resources and advantages of locality may receive the fullest development in view of the general welfare. when we come to entry 42 of list iii concurrent list, we find these words principles on which compensation for property acquired or requisitioned for the purposes 952 the state of bihar . those words, in my opinion, mean no more than that any law made under entry 36 by state legislature can be displaced or overridden by the union legislature making law under entry 42 of list iii. tha. from this survey of the act it appears that the law enacted might be taken to relate to several items in the legislative lists, i.., rights in or over land and land tenures, forests, fisheries, mines and minerals, acquisition of property and also principles on which compensation for property acquired is to be deter mined. on the face of it the legislative provision purports to have been made in exercise of the powers conferred on the state legislature under entry 36 of list ii and entry 42 of list iii of schedule, vii of the constitu tion. the provisions of this clause also jo not take away the court power to examine whether the legislature that made the law has acted in exercise of its law making power within the lists or has merely made some other law though it has ostensibly exercised its powers under certain legislative head which cannot be used to support the legislation. .whatever may be the pct0n as regards the acquisition of money as such it is not correct to say that law made under entry 36 of list ii cannot authorise acquisition of choses in action like arrears of rent due from the tenants which are covered by the term property used in that entry and in art. assuining that the obligation to pay compensation is also implicit in entry 36 of list ii, in itself or read with entry 42 of list iii, even then the validity of the act cannot be questioned by reason of arts. das says, import the obligation to provide for compensation as provided in entry 42 in list iii into entry 36 in ist ii and thereby enlarge the content of the last mentioned entry so as to make it legislative head comprising he compound concept referred to above. it is by force of the provisions of article 3 2 that it be comes obligatory to legislate providing for compen sation under entry 42 of the concurrent list in order to give validity to law enacted under entry 36 and not by reason of the use of the words subject to in the wording of the entry. is there, then, any entry in list ii under which state legislature can make law for acquisition without compensation or pub!ic purpose ? 3. that the vesting of the estates in the state of bihar under the act being in effect an acquisition of the estates, it was invalid as that acquisition was not for public purpose and the provision for compen sation was illusory. further, it must always be borne in mind that the object of .the impugned act is not to authorise the stray acquisi tion of particular property for limited and narrow public purpose but that its purpose is to bring the bulk of the land producing wealth under state ownership or control by the abolition of the system of land tenure which has been found to be archaic and nonconducive to the general interest of the community. the amendment act thus pro vides no immunity from attacks based on the lack of legislative competence under article 246, read with the entries in list ii or list iii of the seventh schedule to the constitution to enact the three impugned statutes, as the amendment act ! to put it shortly, the pro visions of article 3 2 which, as i have explained, require the existence of public purpose, will exclude the implication sought to be read into entry 36 in list ii and entry 42 list iii. their main attack was really grounded on the absence of these two essential .. re requisites of valid legislation authorising acqmston of private property, though mr. das would deduce them by implication from entry 36 of list ii and entry 42 of list iii, while dr. ambedkar sought to derive them from the spirit of the constitution. das but that they mean but not so as to indicate that the scope of entry 36 in list ii is restricted, that is to say, that the subject matter of entry 42 in list iii is not within the content of entry 36 in list ii. tillers of the land and confer on them rights of permanent occupancy and also to bring them directly into contact with the state, all moneys which the pro prietors had collected as and by way of rent from their estates for three years prior to the commence ment of the act, shall vest in and be payable to the state, could it be said by any stretch of reason that any public purpose had been established for the taking of the moneys ? it provides if any bill pending at the commencement of this constitution in the legislature of state has, after it has been passed by such legislature, beert reserved for the consideration of the president and has received his assent, then, notwithstanding anything this constitution, the law so assented to shall not be called in question in any court on the ground that it contra venes the provisions of clause 2. supreme court reports 97 list ii but not having made any law laying down any principle for determining what may, in the eye of the law, be regarded as just compensation at all, the act is ultra vires and void. the obligation to pay compensation may be introduced as part of the legislative power itself, in which case it becomes composite power, namely, power to make law with respect to acqui.sition circumscribed by the obligation to provide for compensation. the provision of clause 2 is only as regards compen sation as can be gathered from its latter part unless the law provides for compensation for the property taken possession of or acquired and either fixes the amount of the compensation, or specifies the principles on which, and the manner in which, the compensation is to be determined and given. supreme court reports 93 it was said that entry 36 of list ii was linked up with entry 42 of the concurrent list by the words subject to occurring therein and that the validity of any law mad. supreme court reports 952 at all, but i regard it, for reasons tated above, as part of principle laid down by the act for the purpose of determining the amount of compen sation as required by article 3 2 and entry 42 in list iii. das, the self same provision be found elsewhere in the same constitution, .., entry 36 in list ii or entry 42 in list iii, then that prorvision must also be regarded as having been covered by article 3 4 and the two added articles, for otherwise those articles will be ren dered nugatory. in list ii by the words subject to et cetera and parliament may, therefore, freely make law with respect to the matters thus excluded from entry 36 in list ii and set forth as separate and independent item in entry 42 in list iii. for any statement that the payment of compensation is primary condi tion for acquisition of property for public purpose, we have to look at the provisions of the constitution itself and this we find in article 32 as stated already. the existence of public purpose as condition precedent to the exercise of the power of compulsory acquisition being then, as i hold, provision of article 3 2, an infringement of such provision cannot, under articles 3 4, 3 and 3, be put forward as ground for questioning the validity of the act. in view of the amendment act any argu_ment regarding the unconstitutionality of the bihar act based on the ground that the provsons of that act contravened articles 4, 9 or 3 of the constitution does not survive and the act is not open to challenge on any such ground. das that the payment of compensation is concomitant obligation to the compulsory acquisition of properties by the state can be accepted as sound but when he went further and urged that it was found in an implicit form in entry 42 of the concurrent list, he was by no means on sure ground. it cannot reasonably be argued that parliament could make law for com pulsory acquisition of property for hs purposes with out fulfilling the condition of making law under entry 42 of the concurrent list, but state legis lature in this respect is in different situation. supreme court reports 903 ground of contravention of tliese provlslons im plies that the law question authorises acquisition without reference to public purpose and without payment of compensation. true, compensation has to be provided for, by reason of subclause 2 of the article, but subclause 4 postulates an exception and the right to challenge the validity of the act on the ground that no compensation has been provided for or that the compensation is really illusory or inadequate ts taken away. that the obligation to pay just compensation for compulsory acquisition of private property is principle of natural equity re cognised by all temperate and civilized governments, that the right to compensation is an incident to the exercise of the power of eminent domain and that the one is so inseparably connected with the other that they may be siaid to exist, not as separate and distinct principles but, as parts of one and the same principle are wellestablished by series of decisions of the american courts quoted by harlan . it is further contended that the legislative power in entry 42 is power coupled with dnty which the legislature was bound to exercise for the benefit of the person whose property was taken in exer cise of the legislative power under entry 36. bihar land reforms act xxx of 950law for abolition of zamindariesvaliditynecessity to provide for compensation and of public purposejurisdiction of court to enquire into validity delegation of legislative powersfraud on the constitutionconsti tution of india, 950constitution first amendment act, 95 arts. learned counsel, however, maintain that although they cannot now challenge the constitutionality of the act on the ground that it contravenes or is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by any of the provisions of part iii of the constitution it is, nevertheless, open to them to call the act into question on other grounds founded on other parts of the constitution or on general principles of law. the high court rejected the plea of the state that article 3 4 of the constitution by reason of the words notwithstanding anything in this constitution excluded article 4 at least in its application to the alleged inequality of compensation. assuming, says he, that, there is in the act general public purpose for compulsory acqui9ition of zamin daries and tenures, there cannot conceivably be any public purpose in suport of the act in so far as it authorises the taking of the arrears of rent or the taking away of 4 to 2! per cent. it was said that the act, while pretending to comply with the constitution, evades and invades it that the act merely pretends to comply with the constitution when it says that it provides for payment of compensation but in effect it has produced scheme for nonpayment of compensation by shift and contrivance. supreme court reports 05 cannot be appropriate by the state unler the power 952 of eminent domain for the mere purpose of adding to the state of its revenues taxation is the recognised mode to secure bihar this end. such acquisition unless the law provides for compensation for the property .... acquired and either fixes the amount of compensation or specifies the principles on which and the manner i which the compensation is to be determined and given. mr. somayya raised further contention that in regard to the malguzari lands covered by the madhya pradesh act, articles 3 and 3 could be of no assistance to the government, as such lands are not estates within the meaning of clause 2 of article 3 with the result that the objection based on article 4 as to discrimination in the matter of pay ment of compensation must prevail. hence article 34, in my opinion, does not bar the jurisdiction of the court from inquiring whether the law relating to compulsory acquisition of property is not valid because the acquisition is not being made for public purpose. 946 supreme court reports 952j mr. das vehemently contended that the statute was fraud on republican constitution which promised to deprive no one of his property without payment of compensation that it pretended to make elaborate provisions for paying it but that by shift and con trivance it has provided for the evasion of its pay ment. 36 of the state list and no. 42 of the concurrent list read together which imposed on the state legislature an obligation to provide for the payment of just or pro per compensation and that the nonobservance of this . ... the contention is that the public purpose must be something definite, something tangible and something immediate and that there must be some indication of its existence in the act itself and that the state cannot take private property today and say that it will think of the public purpose at its leisure. if, however, the word acquisition in entry 36 in list ii and entry 33 in list i does not by itself imply the obligation to pay just compensation, then, urges mr. . . das under the first head, namely, that the obligation to pay compensation is implicit in entry 36 in list ii by itself or read wiith entry 42 in list iii is unsound. thus formulated by formidable and it s with close attention in support of each re ground that article 3 2 imposes upon law for the compulsory acquisition of private pro perty the obligation to provide for compensation and that such obligation is, therefore, provision of article 32 is not challenged. there the power is not to make law for the acquisition of property sim pliciter but is to make law for the acquisition of property on just terms which connotes that the legis lative power itself is circumscribed by the necessity for providing just terms. seriously disputed that such an acquisition amounts to forced loan and that the desired result can be more appositely obtained in exercise of the police power of the state than of the power of eminent domain or compulsory acquisition of property , and that com pensation in such case is the same amount of money 223 .. 390. 952 the same constituent assembly that provi ded the guarantees in article 3 2 in respect of pay ment of compensation and provided the remedy .in article 32 for enforcing the guaranteed right, took awav that rcmedv in the case of the bihar and othe zamindari estates and substituted for it the procedure of article 33 and 4, compliance with which wonld be sufficient to make tbe laws valid and effective. 970 supreme court reports 952 gation flows ftom the mere use of the word acquisi tion in entry 36 in list ii, as in entry 33 in list i. that word, by itself, according to mr. . . in my opinion, this is mere device or pretence and the real object which the legislation intended to accomplish is to deprive man of his money which is not ordinarily subjectmatter of acquisition, in exer cise of what are known as powers of eminent domain by the state, without giving him anything in ex change and under the guise of acting under entry 42 of list iii, the legislature has in truth and substance evaded and nullified its provisions altogether. supreme court reports 99 to him notwithstanding the provisions of articles 3 4, 3 and 3. he does not rely on any other part of the constitution as insisting on the existence of public purpose as prerequisite for compulsory acquisition of private property. power to take was mentioned in entry 36, while the condition for the exercise of that power was embodied in article 3 2 and there was no duty to pay compensation implicit in the content of the entry itself. if principle has beeh laid down in the act but that principle does not in fact produce any compensation in any rare case or adequate compensation in some cases then the real complaint should be, not that no principle has been laid down but, that the principle laid down does not produce what may be called just compensation. but, when these limitations are expressly pro vided for and it is further enacted that no law shall be made which takes away or abridges these safe guards, and any such law, if made, shall be void, there can be no room for implication, and the words acquisition of property must be understood in their natural sense of the act of acquiring property, without importing into the phrase an obligation to pay .. ... 3 4, 3 and 3. iii section 322 of the act which empowers the state government to frame rules providing for the proportion in which compeinsation shall be payable in cash and in bonds and the manner of payment pf such compensation does not involve any delegation of legislative powers especially as the legislature has itself provided in . the words do not mean that when state makes law under entry 36 it must lay down the principles on which compensation payable for property acquired is to be determined and the form and manner in which it should be given. under the land acquisition act, i of 894, declaration by the government that land is needed for public purpose shall be conclusive evidence that the land is so needed and courts cannot go into the question whether the public purpose has been made out or not. the matters comprised in entry 42 in list iii, as legisla tive head, are the principles for the determination of compensation and the form and manner of giving the compensation for property which is described as having been acquired or requisitioned for the stated purposes. the exercise of the power to acquire compulsorily is conditional on the existence of public purpose and that being so, this condition is not an express provision of article 32 but exists aliunde in the content of the power itself and that in fact is the assumption upon which this clause of the article proceeds. das. 972 supreme court reports 952 category or head comprising land and land tenures and all matters connected therewith other than acquisition of land which should be read as covered by entry 36 in list ii. article 3 provides validation of certain acts and regulations with out prejudice to the generality of the provisions con tained in article 3 none of the acts and regulations specified in the ninth schedule nor any of the provi sions thereof shall be deemed to be void, or even to have become void, on the ground that such act, regulation or provision is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by, any provisions . as i explained in gopalan case and again in chiranjit lat case supra our constimtion protects the freedom of the citizen by article 9 to and but empowers the state, even while those freedoms last, to impose reasonable resrictions on them in the interest of the state or of public order or morality or of the general public as mentioned in clauses 2 to 6. the existence of public purpose and an obligation to pay compensation being thus the neces sary concomitants of compulsory acquisition of private property, the term acquisition must be construed as importing, by necessary implication, the two condi tions aforesaid. mr. broom in his work on constitutional law says, next in degree to the right of personal liberty is that of enjoying private property without undue interference or molestation, and the requirement that property shall not be taken for public use without just compen sation is but an aflirmance of the great doctrine esta blished by the common law for the protection of pri vate property. .these appeals and peti tions which fall into three groups raise the issue of the constitutional validity of three state enactments called the bihar land reforms act, 950 bihar act xxx of 950, the chief justice, in his judgment, dealt with the above cases and petition and also petitions nos. the last words in entry 42 form and the manner in which such compensation is to be given clearly mean that the principles determining compensation must lead to the giving or payment of some 0npensation. to negate compensation altogether by the enunciation of principles. of the impugned act are bad for want of public purpose, i am not at all sure that i would not have found it extremely difficult to resist his further argument that the entire act was bad, for it might 952 the state of bihar . arguments as to the obligation to provide for compensation being implied in entry 36 in list ii by itself or read with entry 42 in list iii will also apply to this contention mutatis mutandis and they need not be restated here. entry 42 in list iii only constitutes legislative head under which parlia ment or the state legislatures may make law so as to give effect to the obligation expressly imposed on them by article 3 2. there are indications in article 3 itself to show that the expression acquisition of property in entry 36 of list ii does not in itself carry any obli gation to pay compensation. emphasis is laid on the words subject to the provi sions of entry 42 contained in entry 36 and it is contended that the exercise of legislative power under 952 the state of bihar . in nutshell, it was contended that the object of the act was to acquire properties of the zemindars by payment of compensation socalled out of the moneys belonging to the zemindars them selves and that in some cases they had not only to give up their estates for nothing but would have to pay something, in addition, to the state, if the prin ciples specified in the act were to apply. clause 4 of the impugned act read with the provision of section 24 of the same, empowers the state government to appropriate all the arrears of rent due to landlord at particular time and the only obligation it casts on the government in this respect is to allow 50 of the amount thus appro priated as sollllium for the socalled acquisition. law for compulsory acquisition of private property, to provide for com pensation and either to fix the amount thereof or specify the principles on which and the manner in which the compensation is to be determined and given is the provision of article 3 2. power was given to the state government under section 43 2 to frame rules providing for the proportion in which compensation shall be payable in cash and in bonds and the manner of payment of such compensation. it follows, therefore, that what is sought to be protected by article 3 4 is law for the acqui sition or taking possession of property which does not, amongst other things, proifide for compensation or 26 952 the state of bihar . the constitutionality of these acts having been challenged in the respective state high courts on nrious grounds, the bihar act was declared unconstitutional and void on the ground that it contravened article 4 of the constitution, the other grounds of attack being reject ed while the other two acts were adjudged constitu tional and valid. supreme court reports 952 without payment of compensation, one cannot mp to the conclusion that the whole of the enactment ts fraud on the constitution or that all the provisions as to payment of compensation are illusory. supreme court reports 93 on the motion that it be passed into law, as required by the provisions of rule 20 of the rules governing legislative business then in force, and that the omis sion was not mere irregularity of procedure which the court is barred from enquiring into under article 22 of the constitution. none of these provisions, however, fetter the power of the court to inquire into any other matters the cognizance of which is not expressly taken away by the provisions of clause 4 and articles 3 and 3. therefore, the material point for determination is whether the acquisition of the estates is tor any public purpose that result may offend aganst the provisions of article 3 2 but certainly not against entry 42 in list iii and in view of articles 3 4, 3 and 3 the act cannot be challenged for noncom pliance with article 3 2. to appreciate the contentions raised by mr. das on the question of the competence of the bihar legisla ture to enact the bihar land reforms act, 950, it is necessary to refer to its provisions and to see on what subjects the legislature has purported to enact the law. per mahajan .the phrase public purpose hao to be construed according to the spirit of the times in which the parti cular legislation is enacted and so construed, acquisition of estates for the purpose of preventing the concentration of huge blocks of land in the hands of few individuals and to do away with intermediaries is for public purpose. in other words, article 3 2 must be understood as also providing that legislation authorising expropriation of private property should be lawful only if it was required for public purpose and provision was made for pay ment of compensation. under the constitution, when property is requisition ed or acquired, it may be for union purpose or state purpose, or for any other public purpose. section 43 2 being thus void and inoperative, section 32 2 must also fall to the ground, being vague and incapable by itself of being given effect to, jnd, as payment of compensation was an inextri cable part of the scheme of acquisition under the act, the entire act must go. it was said that article 3 3 provides special safeguard which, in order to ensure that ne hasty or unjust expropriatory legislation is passed by state legislature, requires for such legislation the assent of both the governor and the president, and, to make this clear, the words law and legislature were deliberately used in clause 3. 002 supreme court reports 952 not have been very easy to presume that if the bihar legislature had known that these provisions of the act might be held bad it would nevertheless have passed the other parts of the act in that truncated form. supreme court reports 969 that, in so far as such obligation is found provided elsewhere, the impugied act can well be challenged on the ground that it contravenes or is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges the provisions of those other parts of the constitution, for that ground of challenge has not been taken away by articles 3 4, 3 and 3, by reason of the delimiting words used therein. das in the alternative, the words subject to the provisions of entry 42 of list iii occurring at the end of entry 36 in list ii certainly brings in that obligation. 906 supreme court reports 952 nor is the position improved for the zemindars by reading entry 36 of list ii and entry 42 of list iii te gether. they cannot bear the interpretation sought to be put upon them by mr. das is clear from the fact that similar words do not occur in entry 33 of list i which confers on parliament the power of making laws with respect to acquisition or requisitioning of property for the purposes of the union. .even assuming that the necessity of public purpose is implied in entry 36 of list ii andor entry 42 of list iii also, arts. further, the moment even this regulated freedom of the individual becomes incompatible wi,th and threatens the freedom of the community the state is given power by article 2, to leprive the individual of his life and personal liberty in accordance with procedure established by law, subject, of course, to the provisions of article 22. so far as the united states are concerned, the fifth amendment by providing that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation gave constitutional recog nition to the right of eminent domain and, to protect the subjects, imposed limitation on the exercise of that right by the state. the requirement of public purpose . is implicit compulsory acquisition of property by the state or, what is called, the exercise of its power of eminent domain. as just compensation has to be paid when property is acquired for public purpose, the legislation has to 952 the state of bihar . per das .no hard and fast definition can be laid down as to what is public purpose as tho concept has been rapidly changing in all countries, but it is clear that it is the presence of the element of general interest of the community in an object or an aim that transforms such object or aim into public purpose, and whatever furthers the general interest of the community as opposed to the particular interest of the individual must be regarded as pnblic purpose. 920 supreme court reports 952 entry 36 is conditional on exercise of power under entry 42, that one could not be exercised without the other and that the power conferred by the two entries had to be construed on the assumption that the acqui sitiop. was to be paid for. entry 42 in list iii does not, therefore, impo any duty upon parliament or the state legislatures to make any law for payment of compensation. das, the legislative power under entry 36 in list ii and entry 42 in list iii requires the making of such provson. in these circumstances if the zamindaries and the tenures only are acquired under the act leaving the zamindars and the tenure holders free to realise the huge arrears of rent due by the actual cultivating tenants by legal process it will eventually results in the sale of the holdings of the actual tenants or, at any rate, of their right, title and ... supreme court reports 00 interest therein and the possible purchase thereof by the zamindars or tenureholders themselves at court sales in execution of decrees or by private sales forced upon the tenants. supreme court reports 90 regulation or provision is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by any provisions of this part, and notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any court or tribunal to the conuary, each of the said acts and regula tions shall, subject to the power of any competent legislature to repeal or amend it, continue in force. the bill which subsequently became the bihar land reforms act, 950 was pending at the com mencement of the constitution in the legislature of the state, and after it was passed by the legislature, it was reserved for the consideration of the president and received his assent. it is true that under the common law of eminent domain as recognised in the jurisprudence of all civi lized countries, the state cannot take the property of its subject unless such property is required for public purpose and without compensating the owner for its loss. it is urged that the bihar legislature having purported to exercise its power to make law for compulsory acquisition of property under entry 36 .. 5 app. learned counsel appearing for the respondents accept the position that as result of the con stitutional amendments tle impugned act has been removed from the operation of the provisions of part iii of the constitution including article 4 and that the respondents cannot, therefore, complain of the breach of the equal protection of the laws under arcicle 4 which was the only ground on which the respondents succeeded in the high court. the result of this discussion is that the scope of article 3 4 is limited to the express provisions of article 3 2 and courts cannot examine either the extent or the adequacy of the provsons of com pensation contained in any law dealing with the 952 the state of bihar . atiqa begum, in which it was held that the descriptive words under the legislative head collection of rents are wide .enough to permit lation in respect of remission of rents and that under item 22 of the government of india act, 935, the legislative head forests include the power to legis late with respect not only to afforestation but also to disafforestation and that the legislative head fisheries would include the power to legislate on the prohibi tion of fishing altogether. he argued that the impugned acts were not passed in accordance with the procedure prescribed in article 3 3 which provides no such law as is referred to in clause 2 made by the legislature of state shall have effect unless such law, having been reserved for the consideration of the president, has received his assent. it was conceded by the learned ,advocategeneral of madhya pradesh that these malguzari lands could not be regarded as estates within the meaning of article 3 read with the tenancy acts in force in madhya pradesh, but he contended that, inasmuch as article 3 pur ported to validate specifically the madhya pradesh act among others, and as that article was not limited in its application to estates, the objection could not prevail. this is descrip tion of legislative head and i agree with the learned attorneygeneral that in deciding the competency of the legislation under this entry, we are not concerned with the justice or propriety of the principles upon which the assessment of compensation is to be made under parti cular legislation nor are we concerned with the justice or otherwise of the form or manner in which such compensation is to be given. 3, constitutional limitations is founded on the superior claims of the whole com munity over an individual citizen but is applicable only in those cases where private property is wanted for public use, or demanded by the public welfare and that no instance is known in which it has been taken for the mere purpose of raising revenue by sale or otherwise and the exercise of such power is utterly destructive of individual right. he contended that under this head it was open to the parliament or the state legislature to make law laying down the principles which may result in nonpayment of compensation or which may result in not paying any compensation whatsoever. as regards the new articles 3 and 3, they merely place beyond the reach of the ourt any enact ment dealing with compulsory acquisition of property which may infringe any of the provisions of part iii of the constitution in other words, article 32 of the constitution cannot be called in aid to impugn the validity of such statutes. supreme court reports 933 reserved for the consideration of the president and has received his assent, then notwithstanding any thing in this constitution, the law so assented to shall not be called in question in any court on the ground that it contravenes the provisions of clause 2 . though the main object of the act, viz., the acquisition of estates, is for public purpose, the acquisition of arrears of rent due to the zamindars on payment of 50 per cent. the right to legislate under entry 36 postulates the existence of public purpose and the contention is that there was no public purpose behind the act. the opening words of article 3 are only intended to make clear that article 3 should not be restricted in its application by reason of anything contained in article 3 and are in no way calculated to restrict the application of the latter article or of the enactments referred to therein to acquisition of estates. to put narrow constniction on the expression public purpose will, to my mind, be to ., , ... supreme court reports 999 defeat the general purpose of our constitution and the particular and immediate purpose of the recent amendments. it is by no means easy to impute dishonest motive to the legislature of state and hold that it acted mala fide and maliciously in passing the bihar land reforms act or that it perpetrated fraud on the constitution by enacting this law. de keyser royal hotel limited supra lord dunedin pointed out that the power of acquisition was, in its origin, derived from the prerogative of the crown and that the pay ment of compensation was originally matter of negotiation and bargain between the crown and the subject, but came to be determined later on by statutes of local application and finally by statutes of general application and that, therefore, the crown, which is an assenting party to every statute, must, in effect, be regarded as having consented to the exercise of its prerogative being made subject to payment of compen sation regulated by statutes. compensation provided in the act, if he was not able to convince the court on his main point that he could challenge the offending act on grounds other than those mentioned in part iii of the constitution, and that there was something in entries no. he appear ed to concede what mr. das so strenuously contested, that those entries, concerned as they were with the grant of power to the state legislature to legislate with respect to matters specified therein, could not be taken, as matter of construction, to import an obli gation to pay compensation. it enacts that the ... supreme court reports 92 interests of the proprietor or tenureholder in any building or part of building comprised in such estate or tenure and used primarily as office or cutchery for the colletion of rent of such estate or tenure, and his interests in trees, forests, fisheries, jalkars, huts, bazars, and ferries and all other sairati interests as also his interest in the subsoil including any rights in mines and minerals, whether discovered or undis covered, or whether being worked or not, inclusive of such rights of lessee of mines and minerals, com prised in such estate or tenure other than the interests of raiyats or under raiyats shall vest absolutely in the state free from all incumhrances. it should also be remembered that article 3 4 by reason of the words notwithstanding 952 the state of bihar maharaja dhiraja sir kameshwar singh of darbhanga and others. dissenting.xtion 23 of the act which provides for deduction on percentage basis out of the gross asserts for costs of works of benefit to the raiyat, is ostensibly enacted under entry 42 of list iii, but it is merely colourable piece of legislation, mere device to reduce the gross assets, which does not really come under entry 42 and is unconstitutional. 008 supreme court reports 952 of the union or of state or for any other public pur pose is to be determined, and the form and the manner in which such compensation is to be given. therefore, that the obligation for pay ment of just compensation is necessary incident of the power of compulsory acquisition of property, both under the doctrine of the english common law as well as under the continental doctrine of eminent domain, subsequently adopted in america. section 322 of the act minor point that the bihar reference was made to which runs as follows the amount of compensation so payable in terms of compensation assessmentroll as finally published shall be paid in cash or in bonds or partly in cash and partly in bonds. das that the existence of public purpose is not provision of article 3 2 but is an inherent condition of any legislation for compulsory acquisition of private property. the words acquired or requisitioned for the purposes of the union or of state or for any other public purpose in that entry are merely words descriptive of the preceding word property. under section 24 of the act, 50 lo of these arrears of rent are directed to be added to the amount of compensation money payable for the estate or interest calculated in accord jp ance with the provisions of the act. on the same day, notification under section 3 of the act was published stating that the estates and tenures belonging to the respondent and two others passed to and became vested in th state of bihar under the provisions of the act. the state power to acquire private property is, in essence, power to compel the owner to sell his property when the public interest requires it. it will be noticed that the argument that the .act is unconstitutional is founded on the assumption that it has not laid down any principle for determining compensation as required by entry 42 in list iii and that the provision for compensation is wholly illusory. the principles laid down for the com putation of compensation operated reality as principles of confiscation, and the enactment of the statutes was in truth fraud on the constitu tion, each of them being colourable legislative .expedient for taking private properties , without pay ment of compensation in violation of the constitution, while pretending to comply with its requirements. on proper interpretation of articles 245 and 246 read with entry 36 in list ii and entry 42 in 952 the state of bihar . but it has no application to laws authorising acquisition of other kinds of property and, as regards these, the require ments as to public purpose and payment of compen sation are still enforced by the express provisions of article 32. in the first place the existence of public purpose being, as i hold, provision of article 3 2, its absence, if any, in relation to the arrears of rent cannot, by reason of articles 3 4, 3 and 3 be made ground of attack against the act. this apart, if, as i have endeavoured to show, payment of compensation isi not justiciable issue in the case of the impugned statutes, having regard to articles 3 4, 3 and 3, it is not open to the court to inquire whether deduc tion which results in reducing the compensation is un warranted and therefore, fraud on the constitution. it was further contended that the power to make law under entry 42 of list iii was power coupled with duty, because such law was obviously intended .. ... it will be recalled that the high court of patna held the bihar act un constitutional as being discriminatory in providing for payment of compensation, and it was to overcome that difficulty that articles 3 and 3 were inserted in the constitution. such arrears could not vest in the state as normal result of acquisition of any estate or interest therein, and it is con..cdcd by the learned attorneygeneral that article 3 of the constitution has no application so far as these arrears of rent are concerned. mr. somayya, however, submitted that the opening words of article 3, namely, without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in article 3 showed that the mention of parti cular statutes in article 3 read with the ninth schedule was only illustrative, and that, accordingly, article 3 could not be wider in scope. this argument really has no force, because the provisions as to sessment of compensation enacted in the land acquisition act only apply to acquisitions that are made by notification under that act. go into the coffers 0f the government without any benefit being derived by the tenants that private property could not be acquired for merely augmenting the revenues of the state and that the only purpose that could be gather ed from this act was the ruination of large class of persons without any corresponding benefit to any sec tion of the community. the existence of public purpose is undoubtedly an implied condition of the exercise of compulsory powers of acquisition by the state, but the language of article 32 does not .. .. . ... mr. das is to great extent right in his contention the point was not seriously challenged by the learned attorneygcneral,that the law under challenge in the matter of compensation is highly unjust or inequi table to certain persons and in certain matters, and compensation in some cases is purely illusory. it is said that section 3 of the act, which is its main operative section, does not contemplate or authorise the acquisition of arrears of rent at all, for the notifi cation under that section only refers to the vesting of the estates or tenures in the state. now, the three impugned statues fall within the ambit of both article 3 4 and articles 3 and 3. putting aside the later articles for the moment, it is plain that, under article 3 4, the three impugned statutes are protected from attack in any court on the ground that they contravene the provisions of article 32. even then i would hold that the same reasons, which have weighed with my learned brother in declaring section 23 of the impugned act to be unconstitutional, apply with equal, if not greater, force to section 4 of the act and i have no hesitation in agreeing with him as regards his decision on the constitutionality of this provision of the act though i would prefer to adopt different line of reasoning in support of the same. the constitution, being avowedly one for establishing liberty, justice and equality and government of free people with only limited powers, must be held to contain an implied prohibition against taking private property without just compensation and in the absence of public purpose. the clause presupposes however that the enactment is the result of valid exercise of legis lative power conferred on the legislature by the appropriate entries in the legislative lists and if the legislature acts outside these entries or, under the pre tence of acting within them, does something which is in flat contradiction with its contents, clause 4 of article 3 could not be invoked to afford any protec tion to such legislation. of compensation both of which are referred to in entry 42 is imposed on the exercise of the law mak ing power under entry 36. supreme court reports 923 to the state under the provisions of section and they are to be deemed to be leased by the state to the lessee with effect from the date of vesting. these two, therefore, have not the same origin they do not come, for instance, from any implied watract between the state and the individual, that the former shall have the property, if it will make compensation the right is no mere right to preemption, and it has no condition of compensation annexed to it either precedent or subsequent but there is right to take, 99 .. 744. .. ... the learned judges of the high court negatived this conten.tion on the ground that the ques tion whether there was public purpose in support of the acquisition of the estates had been by implication decided by the constituent assembly and therefore the court could not go into this matter. the state of bihar obtained leave of the patna high court under article 32 of the constitution to appeal to this court and preferred these appeals before us. supreme court reports 953 it was contended that as no date has been ment_ion ed for payment of compensation and no interval has been stated between the instalments mentioned therein and it has not been mentioned how much would be payable in cash and how much in bonds, the act could not be enforced. it has been suggested in course of the argument on behalf of the state that in the present case the government in the exercise of its powers of acquisition could acquire the arrears of rent and as the arrears were still unrealised, it was quite legitimate and proper for the government to deduct half of the gross amount as consideration for the trouble and expense that it would have to undergo in the matter of realising these arrears. article 3 4 and the added articles debar the respondents from questioning the validity of the act on the ground, inter alia, that it contravenes or is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by the provisions of clause 2 of article 3. as the obligation to pay has been made compulsory part of statute that purports to legislate under entry 33 of list i and entry 36 of list ii, it is not possible to accede to the contention of mr. . . tak article 35 ii which protects the provi sions of any law which the state may hereafter make for the promotion of public health or the prevention of danger to life or property. as an incident to thi, power of the state is the requirement that property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation. das fourth point is that the act is unenforceable in that section 32 2 .. i _, ... supreme court reports 005 provides for compensation in forty equal instalments without specifying the period of interval between the instalments. in my opinion, the bihar land reforms act of 950 is not unconstitutional, with the exception of the provisions contained in section 4 and 23 of the act and these provisions alone must be held to be void and inoperative. that the obligation to pay compensation is con comitant to, that is to say, accompanies, the power of compulsory taking of private property by the state cannot be disputed. that the act has no public purpose to support it is sought to be established by saying that ln bihar the recorded pro prietors are about 3,35,99 in number and that assuming that there are four persons in family, nearly five and half million people will be ruined as result of this legislation, although the actual tillers of the soil will derive no benefit whatever therefrom, for they will remain where they are and will have to continue, as heretofore, to pay rj.eir rent, instead of to their present landlords, to the tate which, they will find, is no better than ruthless machine unsusceptible to any humane feeling. entry 33 in list i union list of the seventh schedule to the constitution speaks of acquisition or requisition ing of property for the purposes of the union. similarly, article 33 must, in my judgment, be understood as ... supreme court reports 909 having reference to what, in historical sequence, having been passed by the house or houses of the state legislature and reserved by the governor for the consideration of the president and assented to by the latter, has thus become hw. if, therefore, the state is to give effect to these avowed purposes of our con stitution we must regard as public purpose all that will be calculated to promote the welfare of the people as envisaged in these directive principles of state policy whatever else that expression may mean. this state ownership or control over land is necessary preliminary step towards the implementa tion of the directive principles of state policy and it cannot but be public purpose. the act, according to him, pretends to comply with the constitutional requirements in that it sets out to lay down certain principles on which compen sation is to be determined and the form and the manner in which such compensation is to be given but, in effect, makes out scheme for nonpayment of compensation. supreme court reports 893 3 purported to protect, generally, all laws provid ing for the acquisition of estates or interes.ts therein, and specifically, certain statutes, including the three impugned acts, from attacks based on article 3 read with other relevant articles of part iii of the consti tution. i do not, however, agree with the learned attorneygeneral for the reasons already given by my learned brother in his judgment that legislation under this head need not pro vide for any compensation at all and that legislative provision which declares that no compensation is to be given comes within the ambit of this legislative head. observed as follows from article 3, clause 2, it is clear that the constituent assembly considered two requirements as essential for compulsory acqumt0n, namely, public purpose and provision for compensation. 890 supreme court reports 952 held per curiah mahajan, mukherjea and chandra sekhara atyar jj.thc bihar land reforms act, xxx of 950, is not unconstitutional or void except with regard to the provisions in . the crucial point for determination in these appeals to discover the extent to which article 3 4 of the constitution or the new articles 3 and 3 have deprived the expropriated proprietor of his rights or remedies in respect of this matter and of the guaranteed right to get compensation for property acquired. it may be that some of the provisions of the act may operate harshly on certain persons or few of the zamindars and may be bad if they are in excess of the legislative power of the bihar legislature but from that circumstance it does not follow that the whole enactment is fraud on the constitution. stripped of all dis guise, the net result of the impugned provision is that it would be open to the state government to appro priate to itself half of the arrears of rent due to the landlord prior to the date of the acquisition without giving him any compensation whatsoever. the purpose of the acquisition contemplated by the impugned act therefore is to clo away with the concentraton of big blocks of land ancl means of pro duction in the hands of few individuals and to so distribute the ownership and control of the material resources which come the hands of the state as to subserve the common good as best as possible. finally, it was urged tlat there was nothing definite or tangible in the act or in the views of the legisla tures which gave any indication of the public purpose for which the estates were being acquired and all that could be gathered was that the legislature did not know its own mind at all and on vague notion of some future policy directed the acquisition of the estates. it is impos.iblc to deny that the act is inspired and dominated by public purpose, but the question still remains whether the taking over of particular items can be said to be for public purpose. the phrase public purpose has to he con strued according to the spirit of the times in which particular legislation is enacted and so construed, the acquisition of the estates has to be held to have been made for public purpose. but when legis latu.re has limited or qualified power and has got to act within sphere circumscribed by legislative entries, the question, whether in purporting to act under these entries, it has, in substance, gone beyond them and has done certain things which cannot be accomplished within the scope of these entries, is really question affecting the competency of the legislature. nor is it claimed, in view of articles 3 4, 3 and 3, that it is still open to the respondents to call in question the valid ity of the impugned act on the ground that it contravenes or is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges the provision for compensation made in article 32. the third alternative position is that if the word acquisition in entry 36 in list ii does not, by itself, imply the obligation to provide for compensation and if the words. das that entry 42 in list iii really implements the obli gation implicit in entry 36 in list ii and the two entries are complementary to each other. the act was published in the bihar government gazette on the 25th september, 950, and on the same day notification under section 3 of the act was published declaring that the act would come into force immediately. the concept of the public use has been inextricably related to an appro priate exercise of the power and is considered essen tial in any statement of its meamng. payment of compensation, though not an essential ingredient of the connotation of the term, is an essential element of the valid exercise of such power. in view of the clear provision of that article it is wholly unnecessary to read entry 42 in list iii as imposing an implied duty on the legislature on the principle referred to in the hoose of lords case. mr. das was obliged to take up the unten able position that entry 42 of its own force implies an obligation to pay compensation, as he could not otberwi jump over the hurdles created in his way by subsections 3 and 4 of article 3 and the new articles 3 and 3. das complains that the legislature has shirked its responsibility and delegated this essential legislative power to the state government to be exercised under rules made by itself under its rule making power under section 43 2 . and though the courts cannot examine the extent or adequacy 0f the provisions of compensation contained in any law dealing with the acquisition of property compulsorily, yet the provisions of art. , 896 supreme court reports 952 or of state or for any other public purpose is to be determined, and the form and the manner . supreme court reports 939 for the reasons given above, i hold that the impugned act does not fall for want of public purpose. this very bihar act was before the constituent assembly when it passed article 3 4 and again when it took the trouble of amending the constitution for saving this very act. the answer that comes to imy mind is that it is fraud because the act provides for compensation only on the basiis of income and, therefore, properties which are at present nonincomeyielding but whii have very rich 952 the state of bihar . das founded on entry 36 in list ii and entry 42 in list iii cannot be rejected in limine but have to be considered and i proceed to do so immediately. tained in article 3, none of the acts and regulations specified in the ninth schedule or any of the provisions thereof shall be deemed to be void, or ever to have become void, on the ground that such act, regulation or provision is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by, any provisions of this part, i .. ... this was precisely the objection raised both by mr. das and dr. ambedkar to the constitutional validity of the impugned statutes, and such objection really amounts to calling those laws in question on the ground that they contravened the provisions of article 3 2, though learned counsel stoutly denied that they were relying on the provi sions of article 32. the city objected on the ground that the public landing had become property dedicated to the public under an earlier contract and to allow the condemnation under 952 the state of bihar . the overriding public purpose of ameliorating the conditions of the cultivating raya may well have induced the legislature to treat the arrears of rent and the decrees for rent differently from the other ordinary moveable properties of the zamindars or tenureholders, .., their money in the bank or their jewellery or ornaments with which the rayats have no concern and to provide for the acquisition of the arrears and the decrees. supreme court reports 973 the united states by any provision of the federal constitution, but this power has always been recog nised to exist as an inherent attribute of the sovereignty of the state. it is said that the provision in the act for the acquisition of arrears of rent is fraud on the legis lative power given by the constitution. the court through mr. justice lurton held the constitutional inhibition upon any state law impairing the obligation of contracts is not limitation upon the power of eminent domain. as, however, i have taken the view that no par of the act is bad for want of public purpose, i need not pursue any further the question of the severability of the act or to refer to the judicial decisions relied on by learned counsel on both sides. this condition is implied in the provision of irticle 3 2 of the constitution and although the enactment in the present case fulfills the requirements of clause 3 of article 3 and as 952 the state of bihar . similar arguments may as well be founded on article 3, for that article also protects law from article 3 2 which is in part iii of the constitution. thus in section 3 xxxi of the commonwealth of australia constitu tion act the acquisition of property on just terms has been made head or category of legislative power of the commonwealth parliament. the enunciation of this fundamental right necessarily requires statement of the ambit and scope of the state action and to fix the ambit and scope of the state action it is necessary to specify the limitations on the state action, for that limitation alone the words of the clause preceding the word unless are merely descriptive of the law, the validity of which would be questionable if there was no provision for determina tion and for payment of compensation for the property taken in its contents. the existence of public purpose is not pro vlslon or condition imposed by article 3 2 as limitation on the exercise of the power of acquisition. supreme court reports 983 allowed by the act is about rs. 44,88,585, and the net income computed according to the principles laid down in the act comes to about rs. 2 in this article the expression estate shall in relation to any local area have the same meaning as that ex pression or its local equivalent has in the existing law relating to land tenures in force in that area and shall also include any jagir, inam or musafi or other similar grant the expression rights, in relation to an estate, shall include any rights vesting in proprietor, subproprietor, under proprietor, tenureholder or other intermediary and any rights or privileges in respect of land revenue. supreme court reports 993 that, apart from the absence of any such recital, there is no indication whatever as to the existence of any public purpose in any of the operative provi sions of the act. thus all the objections raised to the constitutional validity of the bihar act, the madhya pradesh act and the uttar pradesh act or any part thereof fail and are overruled. 369 of their report that two conditions should be imposed on expropriation of private property we think it the provision proposed should secure that legisla tion expropriating or authorising the expropriation of the property of private individuals should be lawful only if confined to expropriation for public purpose and if compernation, is determined either in the first instance or in appeal by some independent authority. alcfcgis lative heads have to be reasonably construed and the power given under entry 42 is positive power given to bring about the resuit of payment of compensation and not nonpayment of the same. the act has, however, reversed this rule of economics with the result that part of the money that on the principles stated for determining compensation would be payable by way of compensation to the proprietor or tenureholder stands forfeite by this artificial reduction .of learned counsel stressed the words law and legislature and submitted that, inasmuch as the legislature of state included the governor article 6 . . it seems clear that the act has made sufficient provi sion for enforcing its provisions if section 322 is read with the provisions contained in section 43 and it cannot be said that the act is unenforceable for this reasi.. the last point urged by . again, article 3 4 excludes attack only on the ground of contravention of article 3 2, while article 3 bars objections based on contraven tion of other provisions of part iii as well, such as articles 4 and 9. supreme court reports 905 compensation or condition as to the existence of public purpose. but he maintained that constitutional prohibition against compulsory acqui sition of property without public necessity and pay ment of compensation was deducible from what he called the spirit of the constitution, which, accord ing to him, was valid test for judging the constitutio nality of statute. supreme court reports 967 and notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any court or tribunal to the contrary each of the said acts and regulations shall, subject to the power of any competent legislature to repeal or amend it, continue in force. supreme court reports 907 for the benefit of the expropriated owners, and where the legislature has authorised such expropriation, it was also bound to exercise the power of making law laying down the principles on which such owners should be compensated for their loss. the whole purpose of the clause is to make the obligation to pay compensation condition precedent to the compulsory acquisition of property. when it is said that money and choses in action are exempt from compulsory acquisition, it is not on the ground that they are movable property but on the ground that generally speaking there could be no public pur pose in their acquisition. as has been stated, various grounds of attack were put forward in the courts below, and, all of them having been repeated in the memoranda of appeals and the petitions, they would have requir ed consideration but for the amendment of the constitution by the constitution first amendment act, 95 hereinafter referred to as the amendment act which was passed by the provisional parlia .._. it was not necessary to decide in this case whether under the compulsory acquisition power the state has the power to acquire choses in action or money, but it cannot be . as po!nted out already, article 3 operates as an except0n to article 3 2 read with article 3, only in respect of laws authorising ac quisition of estates and rights thdein, and this exception is to be deemed to have been part of the constitution from its commencement. observed that to take one man property compulsorily maharajit for giving it away to another in discharge of govern dhiraja sir ment obligations is not legitimate and permissible kameshwar singh exercise of the power of acquisition. from very early times, law has recognized the right of government compulsorily to acquire private pro perties of individuals for public purpose and this has come to be known as the law of eminent domain. i ... supreme court reports 945 vest in the state without payment of compensation. supreme court reports 9 an attack was also directed against section 23 which provides for deduction on percentage basis out of the gross assets as cost of works of benefit to the raiyats of such estate or tenure, in ascertaining the net assets on which compensation is to be based. on january 26, 950, when our constitution came in to force, the bill which eventually became the act was pending before the legislature of the state of bihar. das. 986 supreme court reports 952 i would have been that the land so given, not being equivalent in value to the money compulsorily taken away, could not be said to be just compensation. it may be the purpose of the union, or the purpose of the state or any other public purpose. this legislative power of parliament or of the state legis latures is, by article 245, made subject to the provi sions of this constitution. for my part i would be prepared to assume that clause 4 of article 3 relates to everything that is provided for in clause 2 either in express terms or even impliedly and con sequently tle question of the existence of public purpose does not come within the purview of our enquiry in the present case. the meaning of term is flxible and , is not confined to what may constitute public use at any given time, but in general it may be said to cover ... supreme court reports 995 use affecting the public generally, or any number thereof, as distinguished from particular individuals. supreme court reports 003 for just and adequate compensation that mak the act bad, because, according to mr. . . in his constitu tional law at page 86while, as stated above, any and all property is in general subject to the exer cise of the power of eminent domain, there are certain rather unusual forms of private property which can not thus be taken. i of 95 hereinafter referred to as the bihar act, the madhya pradesh act and the uttar pradesh act, respectively. this provision, therefore, in my opinion has been inserted in the act as colourable exercise of legislative power under entry 42 and is unconstitutional on that ground. this cir cumstance unmiistakabry establishes thait entry 36 in list ii, by itself or read with entry 42 in list iii, ha. it was held in that case that bill to restrain the enforce ment of state statute regulating fire insurance rights was valid law in the state of kansas. that provision has been made for the purpose of negativing partially the provisions of the act regard ing payment of compensation. to my mind, our constitution has raised this obligation to pay compensation for the 952 the state of bihar . learned counsel challenged this view of the high court and contended that article 3 4 of the constitu tion is no answer on this point and that the act was bad as it was silent on the question as to why the zamindaris were being acquired that it only provided for the interception of rents which instead of being realized by the zamidars would . 90 supreme court reports 952 for augmenting the treasury could not be regard ed as public purpose such as would justify expro priation of private property. 2 in this article, the expression estate shall, in ielation to any local area, have the same meaning as that expres sion or its local equivalent has in the existing law relating to land tenures in force in that area, and shall also include any jagir, inam or mttafi or other similar grant the expression rights, in relation to an estate, shall include any rights vesting in proprietor, subproprietor, underproprietor, tenureholder or other itermeliary and any rights or privileges in res pect of land revenue. entry 36 covers any purpose except the purpose of the union and is not, in terms, limited to public purpose. the contention put forward on behalf of the respondents is that the neces sity for the existence of public purpose as condi tion precedent to compulsory acquisition of private property is not provision 0 articl! likewise, our constimtion gives protection to the right of private property by article 9 not absolutely but subject to reasonable restrictions to be imposed by law the interest of the general public 950 ... 88. ,, ,. ... supreme court reports 952 any sum payable by such proprietor as agri cultural incometax in respect of any agricultural income derived from such estate or tenure for the previous agricultural year any sum payable by such proprietor or tenure holder as incometax in respect of any income derived from such estate or tenure, other than royalties for the previous agricultural year any sum payable as chaukidari tax or muni cipal tax cost of management of such estate or tenure at rates varying from five to twenty per cent. be that as it may, it seems to me that spite of the criticism levelled against the act by the learned counsel, it cannot be said that the act would fall because it fails to postulate public purpose. the other condition is that no property can be taken unless the law which authorises such appropriation contains provision for payment of compensation in the manner laid down in the clause. the state of bihar maharaja dhiraja sir kameshwar singh f darbhanga and others. he placed no reliance upon entry 36 of list ii or entry 42 of list iii. this clause therefore is unconstitutional legislation made colourable valid under exercise of legislative power under entry 42 of list ii. such laws can be made by state legislature only under entry 36 which must, therefore, be taken to confer legislative power unfettered by any implied restrictions. in my opinion, to give meaning and content to each of the two legislative heads under entry ht and entry 36 in list ii the former should be read as legislative 940 ... 0 at . but is requirement of entry 36 in list ii or entry 42 in list iii. dissenting.the existence of public purpose as prerequisite to the exercise of the power of compulsory acquisition is an essential and integral part of the provisions of art. it is thus clear that section 2992 was intended to secure fulfilment of two conditions subject to which alone legislation authorising expropriation of private property should be lawful, and it seems reasonable to conclude th_at article 3 2 was also intended to impose the same two conditions on legislation ex propriating private property. by three separate but concurring judg ments, the court declared the act to be unconstitu tional and void on the ground of its infringement of fundamental right under article 4 of the constitution. public purpose is an essential ingredient in the very definition of the expression eminent domain as given by nichols and other constitutional writers, even though obligation to pay compensation is not content of the definition but has been added to it by judicial interpretation. during the pendency of the appeal against the decision of the high court the union government with view to put an end to the litigation of the zamindars brought forward bill to amend the constitution and this was passed by the requisite majority as the constitution first amendment act, 95. section 43 of the act empowers the state government to make rules for carrying out the purposes of the act. and the operation of these articles was made retrospective by providing, in section 4 of the amend ment act, that article 3 shall be deemed always to have been inserted and, in article 3, that none of the specified statutes shall be deemed ever to have become void. article 34 is in these terms if any bill pending at the commencement of this constitution in the legislature of state has, after it has been passed by such legislature, been 880 5 app. cas. was suggested that the laws referred to in subclause of clause 5 are laws made in exercise of the taxing power or the police power of the state as the case may be, and that the subclause was inserted only by way of abundant caution. it is gratifying to note that the madhya pradesh abojition proprietory rights act of 950 and the uttar pradesh zamindari abolition and land reforms act of 950 which are also in question are free from this blemish of reaching at arrears of rent due for any period anterior to the date of vesting. one limitation imposed upon the acquisition of taking possession of private property which is implied in the clause is that such taking away must be for public purpose. it cannot be overlooked that the directive principles set forth in part iv of constitution are not merely the policy of any partic cular political party but are intended to be principles fixed by the constitution for directing the state policy whatever party may come into power. the provision herein impeached has not been arrived at by laying down any principles of payh compensation bur in truth, is designed to deprive number of people of their property without payment of compensation. entry 42 in list iii talks of principles on which com pensation is to be determined and the form and the manner in which such compensation is to be given. the legislature is the best judge of what is good for the community, by whose suffrage it comes into existence and it is not possible for this court to say that there was no public purpose behind the acquisition contemplated by the impugned statute. reference was also made to vol. ii of cooley constitutional limitations, at page 744, wherein it is said as follows the purpose must be public, and must have reference to the needs or convenience of the public, and no reason of general pnblic policy will be sufficient to validate other transfers when they concern existing vested rights. what article 3 4 really says is that the contravention of the express provisions of article 3 2 relating to payment of compensation will not be justiciable issue. clause pro vides that all arrears of rents, including royalties and all cesses together with interest, if any, due thereon for any period prior to the date of vesting, which were re coverable in respect of the estates or tenures of the proprietor or tenureholder and the recovery of which was not barred by any law of limitation shall vest in, and be recoverable by, the state. as there can be no acquisition without compensation, th terms of entry 42 enable the legislature to lay down the principles and provide further for the form and . 950 supreme court reports 952 for instance, it may be laid down that the principles for determining compensation will be the rental basis or the market value of the property etc. the only limitation put upon the state action is the requirement that the authority of law is prerequisite for the exercise of its power to deprive person of his property. it has no application to lands acquired under other statutes and, therefore, the provision for compensation of the land acquisition act cannot . money in the hands of citizen can be reached by the exercise of the power of taxation, it may be confiscated as penalty under judicial order and we can even conceive of cases where the state seizes or confiscates money belonging to or in the hand of citizen under the exercise of its police powers on the ground that such fund may be used for unlawful pur poses to the detriment of the interest of the community. the courts hands are tied by the provisions of article 3 4 and that which has been declared by the constitution in clear terms not to be justiciable, cannot be made justiciable in an indirect manner by holding that the same subject matter which is expressly barred is contained impli citly in some other entry and therefore open to exa mination. similarly, clall!se 5 , which excepts certain categories of laws from the opera tion of clause 2, contemplates laws being made with out public purpose or payment of compensation. all legislation in this country authorising such acquisition of property from regulation i of 824 of the bengal code down to the land acquisition act, 894, proceeded on that footing. article 3 4, for instance, speaks of bill being reserved for the president assent after it has been passed by the legislature of state and of the law so assented to. if this obli gation were not implicit in entry 36 in list ii then where else, it is asked, is the obligation to pay compensation to be found ? article 39 of the directive principles of state policy states as follows the state shall, in particular, direct its policy ! it cannot possibly have been intended that the legislature should be under an obligation to make law in exercise of that power, for no obligation of that kind can be enforced by the court against legislative body. the sovereign power to acquire property compulsorily is power to acquire it only for public purpose. i am, therefore, clearly of opinion that the existence of public pur pose as prerequisite to the exercise of the power of compulsory acquisition is an essential and integral part of the provisions of clause 2. without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in article 3 none of the acts and regu lations specified in the ninth schedule nor any of the provisions thereof shall be deemed to be void, or ever to have become void, on the ground that such act, .. .. ... the dominant purpose of the act is that of transference to the state of the interests of proprietors and tenureholders in land and of the mortgagees and lessees of such interests including the interests in trees, forests, fisheries, jalkars, ferries, huts, bazars, mines and minerals. under the guise of

  "summary": "in resisting the workmen claim for bonus for the year 95556 the appellant contended that in calculating gross profits for the purpose of the full bench formula the following items of income should be excluded i income earned by way of rent, light and power ii estate revenue derived from sale of excess coconuts used in preparing oil grown in the appellant groves iii profit from sale of empty barrels and iv sale proceeds of tin cans, scraps, jogs, planks, gunnies etc. as they were extraneous income unrelated to the efforts of the workmen. supreme court reports 3 the ease of the workmen was that the company had z959 made record profits during the year and declared dividend of 2 per centum free of incometax the the tata oil milli workmen were getting much less than the living wage co ltd. and the dearness allowance was not sufficient to fill the its wor,,en and gap, and, therefore, profit bonus at the rate of four others months basic wages should be granted. but apart from these cases, we cannot see how income arising during the year in the normal course of business of the concern can be called extraneous income merely on the ground that no direct connection between the efforts of labour and the accrual of the income has been established. it is this last condition which seems to have been relied upon by industrial tribunals in holding that there must be direct ctmnec tion hetween the efforts of labour and the profits, and unless that direct connection is established the profits must be treated as unrelated to the efforts of labour and thus become extraneous income. messrs. shali mar rope works ltd., shalimar, howrah 2 by observ ing at page 372 that it is however too late in the day to question tlie view that there are profits un related to workers efforts and referred to as extraneous profits and that such profits must be left out of account in deciding the question whether there is available surplus in any particular year. such income or profit may be called extraneous income as either it did not really arise in that year or though it has arisen in that year, labour has not contributed anything towards its accrual it may therefore not be taken into account in calculations according to the full bench formula. i income earned by way of rent, ight and power ii estate revenue iii profit on sale of empty barrels iv excess provision for expenses in the previous year refund of incometax on revision of cochin assessment of excess profits tax vi sale proceeds of tin cans, scraps, logs, planks, gunnies . even so, it may be recognized that there others may be instauees of extraneous income for the pur pose of the ull bench formula due i either to some part of the profits not having bee earned in that year, ii or to some part of profits arising out of fortuitous circumstances altogether unconnected with the efforts of labour. in short, income by way of rent, light and power arises in the normal course of business of the concern and there is no reason why direct contribution by labour during the year in question must be insisted upon in the case of such income. not laid down in the muir mills case that direct connection between the efforts of the workmen and the particular item of profit earned must be established before the profit can be taken into account for the purposes of arriving at the available 955 ... 99. , ... supreme uourt reports 7 surplus. an affidavit was made on behalf of the company that it had used its reserve funds com prising premium on ordinary shares, general reserve, depreciation reserve, workmen compensation reserve, employees gratuity reserve, bad and doubtful debt reserves and sales promotion reserve as working capital. though there must be contribution of the workmen in earning profits before they could be entitled to profit bonus, it was not necessary to establish direct connection between the efforts of the workmen and each item of profit earned. but so far as the other four items are concerned, they are earned by the company in the normal course of its business and there is no reason why they should be excluded on the ground that it has not been proved that they are the result of direct efforts of labour in this year. six items were sought to be excluded by the company as extraneous income, and they were these 4 supreme court reports 960 i959 tht tata oil llfills co., ltd. . income or profit may be extraneous if it either did not really arise in that year or it arose out of fortuitous circumstances altogether unconnected with the efforts of labour or arose out of sale of fixed or capital assets. this income of rs. 3 lacs has 2 0 supreme court reports 960 959 nothing whatsoever to do with the efforts of labour, th oil ll even though it has arisen this year. held, that the four items were earned by the appellant in the normal cour of its business and could not be excluded from the gross profits on the ground that it had not been proved that thev were the result of the direct efforts of labour in the bonus . income received by way of rent of quarters and by sale of scrapmaterials has generally been treated as extra neous income by the industrial tribunals on the basis of these decisions of the labour appellate tribunal. this being the basis on which return on reserves used as work ing capital is allowed, there is no reason why, if there is in fact money available in the depreciation reserve and if that money is actually used during the year as working capital, return should not be allowed on such money also. learned counsel for the rcspondent, appearing before us has stated that the claim with respect to items iv and was con ceded bv the workmen before the tribunal and it seems .jiat by oversight these items were not excluded by it.. he .fairly concedes that these two items may be excluded from consideration in making calculations for arriving at the available surplus. the liquidators were refused sanction to appeal from the said award by the high court whereupon the auctionpurchaser who was also the managing director of the company, prior to its liquidation, preferred an appeal in the name of the company represented by himself as the managing director and also in his capacity as the auctionpurchaser of the company. in the circumstances no case has been made out for increasing the profit bonus beyond what the company has already paid, particularly when we find i that the company has claimed no rehabilitation charges in this year. we are, therefore, of opinion that income from rent, light and power arises in the normal course of business of concern and cannot be treated as extraneous income in the sense described above. the principles laid down in that case show that there must be profits in the particular year for which bonus is claimed, result ing in nn available smplus before profit bonus can be awarded. how can the company claim to exclude the rent etc., from the profits while meeting the expenditure relating to such assets out of the profits, part of which is att.ributable to the efforts of labour? we do not see why this income arising in the normal course of the company business should not be taken into account on the plea that labour has not directly contributed in its accrual. it did not consider the ... supreme cour reports 5 other three items specifically and was content to z959 include them on the general ground that they were the ll profits earned in the course of the company business. the industrial tribunal disallowed the claim of the company on all these three points and after making relevant calculations came to the conclusion that there was sufficient surplus available to permit the grant of bonus for 3l months calculated on basic wages and therefore awarded the same. whatever is the income from the sale of these barrels is in reality reduction in the cost price of chemicals to the company, though by the method of accounting employed it may appear as profit on the sale of barrels. it will, however, be open to the workmen in future to show by proper crossexamination of the company witnesses or by proper evidence that the amount shown as the depre ciation reserve was not available in whole or in part to be used as working capital and that whatever may be available was not in fact so used in the sense explained above. 3 lacs appearing in the accounts due to the change in the method of valuation was no real profit due to the efforts of labour and should not be taken into account in arriving at the available surplus. these items may be taken together, for the nature of the receipt is the same, though on account of the method of accounting employed, the income in the case of barrels is shown as profit while in the case of scrnps etc., it is shown as sale proceeds. the reason given by the tribunal for disallowing these items was that they formed part of the profits earned in the course of the company business .and it was fort.lier observed at page 999 lt is therefore cle.ar that the claim for bonus can be made by the employees only if as result of the joint contribution of capital and labour the indus .rinl concern has earned profits. in carrying on that business it employs th oil ll capita.i as well as labour, and generally speaking the 8 ltd. profits earned in the normal course of business at t4e . these two amounts have gone to swell the profits of this year hut they have not arisen in this year and may, there fore, properly be treated as extraneous income. our attention to number of cases decided by indus its workmen and trial tribunals as well as labour appellate tribunals, others where such items of income have been excluded on wanchoo . its tvorkmen and others the profit of rs. 3 lacs due to

  "summary": "33 of the act for permission to dismiss an employee, he could make good the defect by producing all relevant evidence which would hare been examined at the enquiry, before the tribunal, in which case the tribunal would consider the evidence and decide whether per mission should be granted or not. copies of the statements of witnesses who had given evidence against das were supplied to him or even that the statements made by the witnesses to the manager were read out, in extenso to das before he was asked to question them. new uwarna transport co. ltd. , this court held that rule of natural justice vary vith the varying contitutions of statutory bodies and the rules prescribed by the legis lature under which they have to act, and the ques tion whether in particular case they have been contravened must be judged not by any preconceiv ed notion of what they may be but in the light of the provisions of the relevant act. we should, howeyer, like to make it elear tlrnt the order of tlw tribunal fixing grant of compcnsa,tion till the date of payment must be taken to be limited to the sum of rs. ,25, which has been deposited in this court in pursuance of this court order of april 22, 957 and das will not be entitled . the defect in the conduct of the enquiry could have been cured if the company had produced the witnesses before the tribunal and given an opportunity to das to crossexamine them there. 7 of the act, which provided the qualifications of tribunal, required that where it was one member tri bunal, he should be or should have been judge of high court, or should be or should have been district judge, or should be qualified for appoint ment as judge of high court. they show that when the enquiry was held on march 2, certain persons, whose statements had been recorded by the manager in the absence of das during the course of what may be called investi gation by the company were present. it will he immediately clear that these principles were not followed in the enquiry which took place on march 2, inasmuch as the witnesses on which the company relied were not examined in the presence of das. 7 of the industrial disputes act, 947, prior to the amending act , must be raised before the tribunal itself as it was matter of investigation and could not be raised for the first time before the supreme court. further his evidence does not show that .he statements which had been recorded were read over to das at the enquiry before he was asked to question the witnesses. reference was made by the government of assam on march 8, 956, to the industrial tribunal on the question whether the dis missal of das was justified and if not, whether he was entitled to reinstatement with or without com pensation or any other relief in lieu thereof. i ... supreme court reports 39 before the tribunal was to produce the statements x959 recorded by the manager during what we have called phulbari tea estati investigation. re. 2. the tribunal gave two reasons for holding that the dismissal was unjustified namely that 36 supreme court lteports 960 z959 proper procedure had not been followed, and 2 that ph iba legal evidence was wanting. reason is concerne , ere is .orce critjcism on its workmen behalf of the company that the tribunal had proceed ed as if it was sitting in appeal on the enquiry held wamhoo . enquiry by the employer it could be cured if all the relevant evidence including the witnesses who were not examined in the presence of the workman were produced before the tribunal. the tribunal came to the conclusion that the dismissal of das was not justified on the ground of proper procedure not having been followed and also for want of legal evidence. he gave reply on march , that as the case was sub judice in the criminal court, the question of dismissal did not arise at that stage and the allegations against him would have to be proved in the court. the conpany came up in appeal by special leave to the supreme court, where, for the first time it raised the ques tion of the qualification and competency of the one member tribunal under . inthese circumstances one of the basic principles of natural justice in an enquiry of this nature was not observed, and, there fore, the finding of the tribunal that proper procedure had not been followed is justified and is not open to challenge. in law as it shows as if the tribunal was sitting in appeal on the enquiry held by the company, an this it was not entitled to do. certain persons whose statements had been recorded by the manager at the investigation stage in the absence of das, were present at the said enquiry. thereupon these witnesses were asked whether the evid ence they had given before the manager was correct, and if not, they were at liberty to amend it, to which they replied that the evidence they had given was correct. 5 of the act, and if there was defect in the enquiry by the employer he could make good that .efect by producing necessary evidence before the tribunal. held further, that the basic principle of natural justice in an enquiry was that the opponent must be given the opportunity of questjoning the witnesses after knowing in full what they had to state against him. das was told to ask those persons what they had to say, though he was neither supplied with the copies of the statements made by them nor the statements were read over to him at the time of the enquiry. consequently, it ordered that das would be entitled to his pay and allowances from february 28, to march , 955 and full pay and allowances from march 2, till the date of payment. before the tribunal the company pro duced only the statements of the witnesses but did not produce the witnesses themselves. supreme court reports 37 true that the statements which were recorded were x959 produced on behalf of the company before the tri ph lb . the manager held an enquiry and dismissed das from service for gross misconduct. this conten tion was not raised before the tribunal and therefore the facts necessary to establish whether shri hazarika was qualified to be appointed as tribunal or not were not gone into. but considering that the tribunal was also of opinion that proper procedure had not been followed we have still to see whether that find ing of the tribunal justifies the conclusion at which it arrived."
